## Issues with software installation

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the
[course material](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose/COURSE_MATERIAL.md#issues-with-software-installation).
You can find other resources and alternatives as well.

### The problem

- Installing a software is easy
- However, maintenance is hard:
  - What to do when a new version is available?
  - How to keep track of configuration changes?
  - How to migrate to a new server?

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1548783917-a211bcc263cc?fit=crop&h=720)

### A solution

- A solution can be containerization
- Containerization allows to:
  - Package software with its dependencies
  - Run software in an isolated environment
  - Share software with others

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1511578194003-00c80e42dc9b?fit=crop&h=720)

### An example

- You work as a database administrator
- You have to maintain multiple database servers
- Some projects use MySQL 5.7, others MySQL 8.0
- You must install and maintain multiple versions of MySQL
- Versions can be incompatible with each other
- You must keep track of configuration changes
- Migration to a new server is hard as you have to reinstall each time
- Your life is miserable and depressing... How to solve this?

---

- Just install a container engine (e.g. Docker) on each server
- Find official images for MySQL 5.7 and MySQL 8.0 on the registry
- Start these images as containers - one for each version
- Want to try a new version? Just start a new container!
- Each container is isolated from the others so no more conflicts
- Each container has its own configuration that is easy to track
- Migration is easier: move the data and start the containers!

Containerization has its own challenges but it can help to solve some issues you
may have with software installation and maintenance.

## Bare metal, virtualization and containerization

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the
[course material](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose/COURSE_MATERIAL.md#bare-metal-virtualization-and-containerization).
You can find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Bare metal, virtualization and containerization

- Bare metal: software runs directly on hardware
- Virtualization: software runs on a virtual machine
- Containerization: software runs in a container

![bg right contain](./images/bare-metal-virtualization-and-containerization.png)

### Bare metal

- The traditional way to run software
- Software runs directly on hardware
- Software has full access to the hardware
- Security issues, hard to maintain, hard to migrate

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558494949-ef010cbdcc31?fit=crop&h=720)

### Virtualization

- Virtualization runs virtual machines
- A virtual machine is complete operating system
- A virtual machine is isolated from the host
- Virtual machines are heavy and use a lot of resources

![bg right w:90%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Virtualbox_logo.png)

### Containerization

- Containerization starts containers
- Containers contain all the dependencies to run the software
- Containers are isolated from each other
- Containers are lightweight and use the host kernel

![bg right contain](./images/containerization.png)

A good resource to better understand the differences between bare metal,
virtualization and containerization is the following video:

## OCI, images, containers, and registries

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the
[course material](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose/COURSE_MATERIAL.md#oci-images-containers-and-registries).
You can find other resources and alternatives as well.

### OCI, images, containers, and registries

- Container: runnable instance of an image
- Image: read-only template for container creation
- Registry: service storing images

![bg right contain](./images/oci-images-containers-and-registries.png)

## Docker

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the
[course material](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose/COURSE_MATERIAL.md#docker).
You can find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Docker

- Created in 2013
- Container engine
- Composed of two parts:
  - Docker daemon (background process)
  - Docker CLI
- Can be used to build, run and publish containers

![bg right w:60%](./images/docker.svg)

### Dockerfile specification

- Build a Docker image
- Based on an existing image
- Defines a set of instructions to build the image
- Written in plain text
- Each step creates a layer in the image (takes disk space)

![bg right contain](./images/dockerfile-specification.png)

### Security considerations

- Docker daemon runs as root (= as an admin user), meaning:
  - It has access to the host filesystem
  - It has access to the host network
- The containers have limited access but you still need to be careful
- It is good practice to run containers as non-root users

![bg right:40%](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1496368077930-c1e31b4e5b44?fit=crop&h=720)

### Ignore files

- Same as the `.gitignore` file
- Named `.dockerignore`
- Can be used to exclude files from the build context

```dockerignore
# Ignore target directory
/target

# Ignore all files with .md extension
*.md
```

![bg right contain](../03-git-github-and-markdown/images/git-ignore-files.png)

### Summary

- Docker is a container engine composed of two parts: the Docker daemon and the
  Docker CLI
- The Docker CLI is used to manage containers and images
- The Dockerfile specification defines a standard for building Docker images
- A Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image
- A Docker image is used to create a container
- A container is a runnable, isolated, instance of an image

## Docker Compose

<!-- _class: lead -->

More details for this section in the
[course material](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/blob/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose/COURSE_MATERIAL.md#docker).
You can find other resources and alternatives as well.

### Docker Compose

- Can be used to deploy a multi-container application
- Can be committed with the application
- Can be used to deploy the application on any Docker host
- Easy to use

![bg right w:60%](https://github.com/docker/compose/raw/main/logo.png)

### Docker Compose specification

- Defines the application
  - Services: containers
  - Volumes: shared directories
  - Networks: network communication
- Written in YAML

![bg right contain](./images/docker-compose-specification.png)

### Docker Compose v1 vs. Docker Compose v2

- Docker Compose v1 written in Python (`docker-compose`)
- Docker Compose v2 written in Go (`docker compose`)
- Docker Compose v1 is deprecated

![bg right contain](./images/docker-compose-v1-vs-v2.png)

### Summary

- Docker Compose allows to define a multi-container Docker application in a
  Docker Compose file
- A Docker Compose file can consist of a set of services, volumes and networks
- A Docker Compose file (`docker-compose.yml`) can be easily shared and
  versioned with the application
- Docker Compose v2 is the recommended version to use
