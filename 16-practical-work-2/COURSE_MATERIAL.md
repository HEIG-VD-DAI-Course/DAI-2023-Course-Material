## Introduction

Network applications are everywhere. They are used to communicate, to play
games, to watch videos, to listen to music, to browse the web, to send emails,
etc.

In this practical work, you will create your own network application.

The network application will be defined by an application protocol and two
processes that communicate over the network.

The application protocol and the network protocol(s) it uses (TCP and/or UDP)
will be defined by you.

Feel free to be creative! For example, you can choose to create a chat
application, a chess game, a shopping list, the simulation of an Internet of
Things (IoT) network, etc. If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we
can give you.

Multiple groups can choose the same application protocol and you can share your
methodology but please do not copy/paste code from other groups.

## Objectives

- Define a network application protocol
- Implement a network application that can be used by multiple clients at the
  same time using the TCP and/or UDP protocol(s)
- Package, publish and run a network application with Docker

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do
not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2024-2025 - Practical work 2 - First name Last name member 1
  and First name Last name member 2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Please do it a soon as possible**, even if you do not have a clear idea yet
> as it will help us to plan the practical work presentations.
>
> Please refer to the grading criteria to know what is expected from you.

## Idea validation

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

This will ensure that you have a good balance between the complexity of the
practical work and the time you have to complete it.

If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we can help you finding some
ideas.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without the need of being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> While the grading criteria might not be as detailed as in the previous
> practical works for each section, you **must** continue to apply all the good
> practices you have learned so far.
>
> If elements that are supposed to be acquired through the course or previous
> practical works are omitted, forgotten or poorly implemented, we might
> penalize you.
>
> Remember the UNIX philosophy and the KISS principle: _Keep it simple, silly!_

## Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the picocli dependency
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no
  need to shoot for the moon!)

## Tips

### Create diagrams

You can use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), [draw.io](https://draw.io/) or
any other tools you want to create your diagrams.

### The POSIX standard

> The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) standard is a family of
> standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility
> between operating systems. POSIX defines both the system and user-level
> application programming interfaces (APIs), along with command line shells and
> utility interfaces, for software compatibility (portability) with variants of
> Unix and other operating systems.
>
> <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX>

Not all programs are/can be POSIX compliant. But if you try to comply with the
POSIX standard, you will be able to run your program on various operating
systems without any issues.

## Submission

Your work is due as follow:

- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **01.12.2024 23:59**
- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **05.12.2024 23:59**

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Each day of delay will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the commit hash you
  want to submit

> [!CAUTION]
>
> If you do not update the GitHub Discussion with the link to your repository
> and the commit hash before the deadline, it is considered as a late submission
> and you will be penalized.

## Presentations

The practical work presentations will take place in **room TBD** (next to the
stairs) on:

- DAI-TIC-B (Monday mornings): **02.12.2024 8:30-10:25**
- DAI-TIC-C (Friday mornings): **06.12.2024 8:30-10:25**

We only have **TBD minutes per group**. You decide what you want to show us and
how you want to present it.

**Come 5 minutes before your time slot** (mentioned in the presentation) with
your computer. You will have access to a video projector.

**Please state your group on GitHub Discussions before next week**. This will
allow us to prepare the order of presentation.

<!--
The order of presentation is random and is stated in the next tables:

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
