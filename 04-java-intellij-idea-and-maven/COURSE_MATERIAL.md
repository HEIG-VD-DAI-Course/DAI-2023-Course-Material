## Objectives

This chapter will help you understand how Java can run on all platforms, how to
install and switch between different versions of Java, how to use IntelliJ IDEA
to develop Java applications, how to use Maven to manage dependencies and build
Java applications.

These skills are essential to develop Java applications in a professional
environment to share them with other developers.

Let's get started!

## Java

> [Java](https://www.java.com/) is a general-purpose, class-based,
> object-oriented programming language. It is intended to let programmers write
> once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all
> platforms that support Java, thanks to the Java virtual machine (JVM).

Java was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle
Corporation) and released in 1995.

Java is a very popular programming language, especially for client-server web
applications.

### Java virtual machine

Java is a **compiled** language, meaning that the source code is compiled to
bytecode, which is then executed by a **Java virtual machine (JVM)**.

Java is intended to be **portable**, meaning that compiled Java code can run on
all platforms that support Java, without the need for recompilation, thanks to
the JVM.

### JVM versions

Many implementations of the JVM exist, targeting **different hardware and
software environments and/or specific optimizations** for a given platform
and/or use-case.

In order to install Java on your computer, you may find the **JDK (Java
Development Kit)** or the **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)** packages.

If you want to develop Java applications, you will need the JDK. If you want to
run Java applications, you will need the JRE.

### Java versions and version managers

Java has various **versions**, each with its **own set of features and
improvements**. The latest Long term support (LTS) version is **Java 17**.

As projects can use different versions of Java, it is common to use a **version
manager** such as [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).

Version managers allow you to **install and switch between different versions of
Java**.

While working on a project, you should **use the same version of Java as the
other developers** to ensure that the project compiles and runs correctly.

You can develop Java applications using a text editor and the command line, but
it is more convenient to use an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**.

### Compiling and running Java programs

A (simple) Java application can be compiled using the `javac` command:

```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
```

The resulting bytecode can be executed using the `java` command:

```sh
java HelloWorld
```

Output:

```text
Hello DAI students!
```

A Java application can be packaged into a **JAR (Java ARchive)** file, which is
a **ZIP file** containing the compiled bytecode and other resources.

A JAR file can be executed using the `java` command:

```sh
java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.1.20.1.jar nogui
```

The `-Xmx1024M` and `-Xms1024M` options define the **maximum** and **initial**
memory allocation pool for a Java virtual machine (JVM), respectively.

These options can tweak the performance of the JVM, depending on the
application.

As many Java applications depend on external libraries, it is common to use a
**dependency manager** such as **[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)** or
**[Gradle](https://gradle.org/)**.

### Summary

- Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language.
- Java is compiled to bytecode, which is then executed by a Java virtual machine
  (JVM).
- Java is intended to be portable, thanks to the JVM.
- Java has various versions, each with its own set of features and improvements.
- Versions managers allow you to install and switch between different versions
  of Java.

## IntelliJ IDEA

> [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is an integrated development
> environment (IDE) written in Java for developing computer software. It is
> developed by JetBrains, and is available as an Apache 2 Licensed community
> edition, and in a proprietary commercial edition.

IntelliJ IDEA is a very popular IDE for Java development, but it also supports
many other programming languages.

### Community Edition and Ultimate Edition

IntelliJ IDEA is available in two editions: the **Community Edition** (free and
open-source) and the **Ultimate Edition** (proprietary).

You are eligible for a **free student license** for the Ultimate Edition, which
you can obtain by following the instructions on the
[JetBrains Student License](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)
page.

IntelliJ IDEA is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Feel free to use
another IDE if you prefer, but we have great experience with IntelliJ IDEA.

### IntelliJ IDEA Toolbox App

The **IntelliJ IDEA Toolbox App** is a desktop application that allows you to
**install and manage multiple JetBrains IDEs**.

It is a convenient way to install and update IntelliJ IDEA and other JetBrains
IDEs in a single place.

### Configuration files and Git

When creating a new project, IntelliJ IDEA will create a `.idea` directory
containing the project configuration files.

Some of these files must be **ignored** by Git, as they contain **local
configuration** that is specific to your computer.

Other files must be **committed** to Git, as they contain **project
configuration** that is shared between all developers.

This allows you to **share the project configuration** with other developers, so
that they can open the project in their instance of IntelliJ IDEA and have the
same configuration as you and ensure that the project compiles and runs
correctly.

### Summary

- IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Java
  for developing computer software.
- IntelliJ IDEA is available in two editions: the Community Edition (free and
  open-source) and the Ultimate Edition (proprietary).
- You are eligible for a free student license for the Ultimate Edition.

## Maven

> [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is a software project management and
> comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM),
> Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central
> piece of information.

Maven is a **dependency manager** for Java projects. It is used to **manage
external libraries** (also called **dependencies**) used by your application.
Maven is a **command-line tool**. It can be used using the `mvn` command.

Maven is also a **build automation tool**. It is used to **compile** your
application, **run** your unit tests, **package** your application, etc.

### Maven project structure

Maven defines a **standard directory structure** for Java projects, so that all
developers can find the source code, unit tests, etc. in the same place. It
**standardizes the build process** of your application, so that all developers
can build the project in the same way.

When creating a new project in IntelliJ IDEA, you can choose between different
**project templates**.

In this course, you will use the **Maven** project template.

IntelliJ IDEA will automatically create a **Maven project structure** for you,
with the following files:

- `pom.xml`: the **Project Object Model (POM)** file, which is the core of a
  Maven project.
- `src/main/java`: the **source code** of your application.
- `src/test/java`: the **unit tests** of your application.

### `pom.xml` file

The `pom.xml` file contains the **configuration** of your Maven project.

It also contains the **build configuration** of your application, which defines
how your application is compiled, tested, packaged, etc.

It contains the **dependencies** of your application, which are **external
libraries** used by your application.

The `pom.xml` file is **shared** between all developers, so that they can
**compile** and **run** the application in the same way.

The standard `pom.xml` file contains the following sections (among others):

- `groupId`: the name of the organization that created the project. It defines
  the **namespace** of the project.
- `artifactId`: the name of the project.
- `version`: the version of the project.
- `packaging`: the packaging type of the project.
- `name` and `description`: the name and description of the project.
- `dependencies`: the dependencies of the project.

The `artifactId`, `version` and `packaging` sets the **name of the JAR file**.

### Maven lifecycle

Maven defines a **standard build process** for Java projects, called the **Maven
lifecycle**.

The Maven lifecycle is composed of **phases**. Each phase is composed of
**plugin goals**.

For example, the `compile` phase is composed of the `compiler:compile` plugin
goal and the `package` phase is composed of the `jar:jar` and
`plugin:addPluginArtifactMetadata` plugin goal, which will generate a JAR file.

More details about the Maven lifecycle can be found in the official
documentation:
<https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html>.

### Maven Repository

The [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/) is a **public repository** of
**Java libraries**. It contains many libraries that you can use in your
projects.

You can search for a library and copy the **dependency declaration** to your
`pom.xml` file.

For example, the following dependency declaration adds the
**[Logback](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ch.qos.logback/logback-classic/1.4.11)**
library to your project:

```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ch.qos.logback/logback-classic -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
    <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.11</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Maven installation and its wrapper

The installation of Maven is a bit different than other software you might be
used to as there is not an installer program to install Maven. Instead, Maven
comes as a **single archive**, containing the Maven executable file and other
files that you have to install manually.

This means that you have to extract the archive and install Maven manually by
creating a directory on your computer and adding it to your `PATH` so you can
use its command `mvn` anywhere in your terminal.

If you are on Linux, you can install Maven using your distribution package
manager. This will install Maven automatically as intended and you will then be
able to use its command `mvn` anywhere.

If you are on macOS, you can install Maven using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
This will install Maven automatically as intended and you will then be able to
use its command `mvn` anywhere.

If you are on Windows, you have to create a directory in your `C:\Program Files`
directory and add it to your `PATH` so you can use its command `mvn` anywhere in
your terminal.

The Windows installation is not very convenient, as you have to install Maven
manually and update it manually when a new version is released. These steps are
prone to errors, hard to manage and inconvenient to update.

This is why some Maven projects use a **Maven wrapper**. A wrapper is a
**script** (a shell script on Linux and macOS and a Batch script on Windows)
that will download and run Maven for you, even if you do not have Maven
installed on your computer.

These scripts can be committed to any Git repository, shared with your team and
used on any platform without the need to have Maven installed beforehand. You
can then use the wrapper script to download and run Maven.

The Maven wrapper defines the **version of Maven** to use, so that all
developers use the same version of Maven.

The Maven wrapper and its configuration file are **committed** to Git but the
Maven executable file is **ignored** by Git.

A new developer can then **run** the Maven wrapper to **download** and
**execute** Maven, ensuring that all developers use the same version of Maven.

### Summary

- Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.

### Cheat sheet

```sh
# Download the dependencies
mvn dependency:resolve

# Delete the compiled classes
mvn clean

# Compile the source code
mvn compile

# Package the application
mvn package
```

Multiple phases can be executed in a single command:

```sh
# Delete the compiled classes, compile the source code and package the application
mvn clean compile package
```

## Practical content

### Install Java

In this section, you will install Java using the version 17 from Temurin.

#### Install Java

If you are using Linux (WSL excluded) or macOS, you can install and use
[SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to install and switch between different versions
of Java.

Then, install Java 17 Temurin:

```sh
# Install Java 17 Temurin
sdk install java 17.0.8-tem
```

If you are on Windows, we recommend to install Java 17 directly on your system,
without using a version manager even if you are using WSL.

Install Java 17 Temurin from the official website: <https://adoptium.net/>.

#### Check the installation

Open a terminal and type `java --version`.

The output should be similar to this:

```text
openjdk 17.0.8 2023-07-18
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.8+7 (build 17.0.8+7)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.8+7 (build 17.0.8+7, mixed mode, sharing)
```

### Install and run Maven

In this section, you will install Maven. In a future section, you will
initialize the Maven wrapper using Maven itself.

#### Install Maven

If you are using Linux (WSL excluded) or macOS, use your package manager to
install Maven. This will add Maven to your `PATH` so you can use its command
`mvn` anywhere.

If you are using Windows, you have to install Maven manually.

Download the latest version of Maven from the official website:
<https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi>. Download the **Binary archive**, not
the Source archive. Once downloaded, extract the archive to a directory of your
choice, such as `C:\Program Files\apache-maven`.

Then add Maven from the directory you previously created
(`C:\Program Files\apache-maven` for example) to your `PATH` manually. You can
follow this tutorial: <https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-maven-windows>.

#### Check the installation

Open a terminal and type `mvn`.

The output should be similar to this:

```text
Apache Maven 3.9.4 (dfbb324ad4a7c8fb0bf182e6d91b0ae20e3d2dd9)
Maven home: /Users/ludelafo/Downloads/apache-maven-3.9.4

Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "13.5.1", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"
```

### Install and configure IntelliJ IDEA

In this section, you will install and configure IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition.

You can use another IDE if you prefer, but we have great experience with
IntelliJ IDEA.

#### Enable the IntelliJ student license

Follow the official documentation to enable the IntelliJ student license:
<https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students>

#### Download and install IntelliJ Toolbox App

Go to the official website and following the instructions on how to install
IntelliJ Toolbox App on your system: <https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/app>.

#### Enable the student license in IntelliJ Toolbox App

Open IntelliJ Toolbox App and login with your JetBrains account.

> [!NOTE]

> Thanks!

#### Install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition

Install IntelliJ IDEA from the Toolbox App and you should be good to go!

### Create and run a new Maven project with IntelliJ IDEA

In this section, you will create a new Maven project with IntelliJ IDEA.

#### Create the IntelliJ IDEA project

Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new project. Fill the form as shown in the
following screenshot:

![Create the Maven project](images/practical-content-create-the-maven-project.png)

#### Run the Java project from IntelliJ IDEA

Press the "Run" button in the toolbar to run the Maven project.

The output should be `Hello World!` in the "Run" tab.

#### Initialize the Maven wrapper

The Maven wrapper is a good practice to ensure that all developers use the same
version of Maven. This allows new developers to run the Maven wrapper to
download and run Maven, without having to install Maven on their computer first
(and avoid complex installation steps on Windows).

In order to use the Maven wrapper, you have to initialize it using Maven.

Open a terminal within IntelliJ IDEA. Initialize the Maven wrapper using the
following command:

```sh
# Initialize the Maven wrapper
mvn wrapper:wrapper
```

This will create the Maven wrapper files in your project:

```text
.
├── .mvn
│   └── wrapper
│       ├── maven-wrapper.jar
│       └── maven-wrapper.properties
├── mvnw
└── mvnw.cmd
```

The `mvnw` and `mvnw.cmd` files are the Maven wrapper scripts. These files are
committed to Git.

The `maven-wrapper.jar` file is the Maven wrapper itself. This file is not
committed to Git.

The `maven-wrapper.properties` file contains the configuration of the Maven
wrapper. This file is committed to Git.

Now, instead of using the Maven version you installed locally, you can use the
Maven wrapper that will download and run Maven for you with a specific version.

```sh
# Check the Maven version
./mvnw --version
```

The output should be similar to the previous execution of Maven.

You have to execute these steps only once per project. Once the Maven wrapper is
initialized, you can use it to run Maven, as well as all other developers of the
project.

#### Update the `pom.xml` file to generate a JAR file

Maven uses the `pom.xml` file to define the **build process** of your
application.

Maven has a plugin called `maven-jar-plugin` that can be used to **generate a
JAR file** from your application.

Add the following configuration to the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <artifactId>maven-jar-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.3.0</version>
                <configuration>
                    <archive>
                        <manifest>
                            <mainClass>ch.heigvd.Main</mainClass>
                        </manifest>
                    </archive>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

You can find the latest version of the `maven-jar-plugin` on the Maven
Repository:
<https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-jar-plugin>.

#### Package and run the project from the command line

You can now generate a JAR file using the `package` command:

```sh
# Package the application
./mvnw package
```

Maven will generate a JAR file in the `target` directory.

Run the JAR file using the `java` command:

```sh
# Run the application
java -jar target/java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The output should be `Hello World!`.

Congratulations! You have successfully created and run your first Maven project!

You could share this JAR file with other developers and they could run it on
their computer, without having to install IntelliJ IDEA or Maven.

#### Store the Maven configuration as IntelliJ IDEA Run/Debug configuration

Running Maven commands from the command line is not very convenient. You can
store the Maven configuration as an IntelliJ IDEA Run/Debug configuration.

This will allow you to run Maven commands from IntelliJ IDEA, without having to
open a terminal.

Other developers will also be able to run Maven commands from IntelliJ IDEA, as
the Run/Debug configurations can be committed to Git.

In the "Run" tab, click on the "Edit Configurations..." button.

Click on the "+" button and select "Maven".

Fill the form as shown in the following screenshot:

![Create the Maven Run/Debug configuration](images/practical-content-store-the-maven-configuration-as-intellij-idea-run-debug-configuration.png)

Notice the **Run** command: `dependency:resolve clean compile package`.

This will **download the dependencies**, **delete** the compiled classes,
**compile** the source code and **package** the application.

By checking the **Store as project file** checkbox, the Run/Debug configuration
will be stored in the `.idea` directory, which can be committed to Git.

Make usage of the Maven wrapper by modifying the **Maven option**.

Save the configuration and run it by pressing the "Run" button in the toolbar.

The output should be similar to the previous execution of Maven.

#### Add a dependency

Let's add the
[Logback](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ch.qos.logback/logback-classic)
dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

```xml
    <dependencies>
        <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ch.qos.logback/logback-classic -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
            <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
            <version>1.4.11</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> What is the difference between a Maven dependency and a Maven plugin ? A
> plugin performs a specific task, such as compiling the source code or
> generating a JAR file. It won't be included in the JAR file generated by
> Maven. A dependency is an external library used by your application, such as

>
> You can find more information about this in
> [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52119718)

Update the `src/main/java/ch/heigvd/Main.java` file to use Logback:

```java
package ch.heigvd;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Main.class);

        logger.debug("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Download the Logback dependency by running the Maven `dependency:resolve`
command:

```sh
# Download the dependencies
./mvnw dependency:resolve
```

Run the **Current file** Run/Debug configuration to execute the application
within IntelliJ IDEA.

> [!TIP]  
> Having trouble with IntelliJ IDEA not recognizing the `Logger` class? Try the
> following: **Right-click on the project** > **Maven** > **Reload project**.
> This will reload the Maven project and download the dependencies.

#### Build and run the project

Build the project using the Maven `package` command:

```sh
# Package the application
./mvnw package
```

Run the JAR file using the `java` command:

```sh
# Run the application
java -jar target/java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

It does not work! The output is an error message:

```text
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/LoggerFactory

Why? Because the `maven-jar-plugin` does not include the dependencies in the JAR
file by default.

Let's fix this.

#### Update the `pom.xml` file to include the dependencies in the JAR file

Update the `pom.xml` file to include the dependencies in the JAR file. You need
to replace the previous `build` section with the following:

```xml
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.5.0</version>
                <executions>
                    <execution>
                        <phase>package</phase>
                        <goals>
                            <goal>shade</goal>
                        </goals>
                        <configuration>
                            <transformers>
                                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ManifestResourceTransformer">
                                    <mainClass>ch.heigvd.Main</mainClass>
                                </transformer>
                                <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.DontIncludeResourceTransformer">
                                    <resource>MANIFEST.MF</resource>
                                </transformer>
                            </transformers>
                        </configuration>
                    </execution>
                </executions>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

This will use the `maven-shade-plugin` to include the dependencies in the JAR
file.

You can find the latest version of the `maven-shade-plugin` on the Maven
Repository:
<https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.maven.plugins/maven-shade-plugin>.
This plugin will intervene in the `package` phase of the Maven build process. It
will execute the `shade` goal, which will transform the JAR file to include the
dependencies.

A goal is a specific command that can be executed by a plugin.

Build and run the project using the following commands:

```sh
# Download the dependencies
./mvnw dependency:resolve

# Package the application
./mvnw package

# Run the application
java -jar target/java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The output should now be `Hello World!` again!

You should notice the following elements:

- The `target` directory contains the
  `java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file
- A new `original-java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file was
  created
- A new `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` file was created

The `java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file is the JAR file
generated by the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin with all dependencies included.

The `original-java-intellij-idea-and-maven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` file is the JAR
file generated by the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin without all dependencies
included. If you try to run the application with this JAR file, you will get the
same error as before.

The `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` file is a **reduced version** of the `pom.xml`
file, containing only the dependencies used by the application and not the
transitive dependencies.

#### Initialize a local Git repository

Open a terminal within IntelliJ IDEA and initialize a local Git repository:

```sh
# Initialize a local Git repository with a branch called `main`
git init --initial-branch=main
```

#### Ignore files for Git

By default, IntelliJ IDEA did create a `.gitignore` file and a
`.idea/.gitignore` file containing the files to be ignored by Git.

If you open these files, you will notice that it contains many files and
directories that are specific to IntelliJ IDEA, but also for other IDEs and
specific configurations.

Many tools exist to generate `.gitignore` files, such as
<https://gitignore.io/>. We consider these as **bad practice** as it makes the
comprehension of the codebase harder (_What am I really using?_). You should
**only ignore files that are specific to your project**, the tools you are using
and the environment you are working in.

Let's clean the `.gitignore` files.

Open the `.gitignore` file update the content to the following:

```sh
## IntelliJ IDEA

# General
.idea/libraries/
.idea/shelf/
.idea/compiler.xml
.idea/jarRepositories.xml
.idea/modules.xml
.idea/workspace.xml
*.iws
*.iml
*.ipr

# Editor-based HTTP Client requests
.idea/httpRequests/

# Datasource local storage ignored files
.idea/dataSources/
.idea/dataSources.local.xml

## Linux

# Temporary files
*~

## macOS

# Files created by macOS Finder
.DS_Store

## Maven
.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
target/

## Windows

# Windows thumbnail cache files
Thumbs.db

# Folder config file
[Dd]esktop.ini
```

Delete the `.idea/.gitignore` file.

#### Add a README

Add a `README.md` file to explain what the project is, how to build it and how
to run it.

#### Create a GitHub repository

Create a new GitHub repository as seen in a previous chapter. Do not initialize
it with a README, a license or a `.gitignore` file.

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not initialize the repository with a README, a license or a `.gitignore`
> file! You will add these files later.

#### Add the remote repository and push the project to GitHub

GitHub should provide you with the commands to add the remote repository and
push the project to GitHub:

```sh
# Add the remote repository
git remote add origin <URL_TO_YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY>

# Add the files to the staging area
git add .

# Check that only the required files are added to the staging area
git status

# Commit the files to the local repository
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push the project to GitHub
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

The last command will push the `main` branch to the `origin` remote repository
and set the `main` branch as the default branch.

Open the GitHub repository in your browser and check that the files have been
pushed to GitHub.

#### Share your project in GitHub Discussions

Share your project in the GitHub Discussions of this organization:
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions>.

Create a new discussion with the following information:

- **Title**: DAI 2023-2024 - My IntelliJ + Maven project - First name Last Name
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: The link to your GitHub repository

This will notify us that you have completed the exercise and we can check your
work.

You can compare your solution with the official one stated in the
[Solution](#solution) section, however, **we highly recommend you to try to
complete the practical content by yourself first to learn the most**.

  [documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html) and try it
  out!
- Try to clone and run one of your classmates' project shared in GitHub
  Discussions. Do you have any issues? If yes, can you help them to improve
  their project?

## Conclusion

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have installed and configured Java, IntelliJ IDEA and
Maven. You have created a Java project with Maven, added a dependency to a Maven
project, and built a JAR that you can execute everywhere. You have learned how
these tools can help you to develop Java applications and share them with other
developers.

Dependencies management is a very important (yet tricky) topic. In the context
of this course, you will not go any deeper as you will cover in other future
courses.

### Test your knowledge

At this point, you should be able to answer the following questions:

- How can Java run on all platforms?
- How can you install and switch between different versions of Java?
- Why should you ignore some files created by IntelliJ IDEA?
- What is the purpose of the `pom.xml` file?
- How can a tool like Maven help you to develop Java applications?
