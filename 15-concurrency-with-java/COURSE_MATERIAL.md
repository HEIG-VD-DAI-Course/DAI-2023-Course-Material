## Objectives

As you have seen in previous chapters, applications communicate with each other
using application protocols.

Some tools are created to interact with these protocols. For example, you can
use Telnet to interact with the SMTP protocol to send emails or SCP to interact
with the SSH protocol to transfer files.

In this chapter, you will learn how to program your own TCP clients and servers
in Java.

This will allow you to create your own network applications, such as a chat
server, a file server, a web server, etc.

## TCP

TCP is a transport protocol. It is used to transfer data between two
applications. TCP can only do UniCast: one application can only communicate with
one other application.

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol: a connection must be established between
the two applications before data can be exchanged in a bidirectional way.

TCP is a reliable protocol: data sent is guaranteed to be received by the other
application.

A good analogy is to think of TCP as a phone call. You must first establish a
connection with the other person before you can talk to them. Once the
connection is established, you can talk to the other person and they will hear
everything you say.

With the help of port numbers, TCP allows multiple applications to communicate
with each other on the same machine.

TCP is a stream-oriented protocol: data is sent as a stream of bytes. The
application must split the data into segments. Each segment is identified by a
sequence number.

TCP segments are encapsulated in IP packets, called payloads.

Thanks to the sequence numbers, TCP is able to reassemble the segments in the
correct order. If a segment is lost, TCP will retransmit it.

## The Socket API

The Socket API is a Java API that allows you to create TCP/UDP clients and
servers. It is described in the
[`java.net` package](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/package-summary.html)
in the
[`java.base` module](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html).

It has originally been developed in C in the context of the Unix operating
system by Berkeley University. It has been ported to Java and is now available
on many platform and languages.

To make it simple, a socket is just like a file that you can open, read from,
write to and close. To exchange data, sockets on both sides must be connected.

A socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.

A socket can act as a client or as a server:

- A socket accepting connections is called a server socket (class
  [`ServerSocket`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/ServerSocket.html)).
- A socket initiating a connection is called a client socket (class
  [`Socket`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/Socket.html)).

The following schema shows the workflow of a client/server application:

![Client/server application workflow](./images/client-server-workflow.png)

### Client/server common methods

| Operation           | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `socket()`          | Creates a new socket               |
| `getInputStream()`  | Gets the input stream of a socket  |
| `getOutputStream()` | Gets the output stream of a socket |
| `close()`           | Closes a socket                    |

### Client workflow and methods

In order to create a client, the following workflow is followed:

> 1. Create a socket (class `Socket`)
> 2. Connect the socket to an IP address and a port number
> 3. Read and write data from/to the socket
> 4. Flush and close the socket

The available methods are the following:

| Operation   | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect()` | Connects a socket to an IP address and a port number |

### Server structure and methods

In order to create a server, the following workflow is followed:

> 1. Create a socket (class `ServerSocket`)
> 2. Bind the socket to an IP address and a port number
> 3. Listen for incoming connections
> 4. Loop
>    1. Accept an incoming connection - creates a new socket (class `Socket`) on
>       a random port number
>    2. Read and write data from/to the socket
>    3. Flush and close the socket
> 5. Close the socket (`ServerSocket`)

The available methods are the following:

| Operation  | Description                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `bind()`   | Binds a socket to an IP address and a port number |
| `listen()` | Listens for incoming connections                  |
| `accept()` | Accepts an incoming connection                    |

## Processing data from streams

Sockets use data streams to send and receive data, just like files.

You get an input stream to read data from a socket and an output stream to write
data to a socket.

```java
// Get input stream
input = socket.getInputStream();

// Get output stream
output = socket.getOutputStream();
```

You can then decorate the input and output streams with other streams to process
the data.

```java
// Get input stream as text
input = new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

// Get output stream as text
output = new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

Use buffered streams to improve performance.

```java
// Get input stream as binary with buffer
input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream());

// Get output stream as binary with buffer
output = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(socket.getOutputStream());
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not forget to flush the output stream after writing data to it. Otherwise,
> the remaining data in the buffer will not be sent to the other application!
>
> ```java
> out.flush();
> ```
>
> Also, do not forget all the good practices seen in the
> [Java IOs chapter](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/05-java-ios)
> (encoding, buffering, etc.). They must be applied here too!

### Variable length data

Depending on the application protocol, the data sent can have a variable length.

There are two ways to handle variable length data:

- Use a delimiter
- Use a fixed length

If the data has a delimiter, you can use a buffered reader to read the data
until the delimiter is found.

```java
// End of transmission character
String EOT = "\u0004";

// Read data until the delimiter is found
String line;
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null && !line.equals(EOT)) {
  System.out.println(
    "[Server " + SERVER_ID + "] received data from client: " + line
  );
}
```

If the data has a fixed length, you must send the length of the data before
sending the data itself.

```java
// Send the length of the data
out.write("DATA_LENGTH " + data.length() + "\n");

// Send the data
out.write(data);
```

```java
// Read the length of the data
String[] parts = in.readLine().split(" ");
int dataLength = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);

// Read the data
for (int i = 0; i < dataLength; i++) {
  System.out.print((char) in.read());
}
```

## Handling one client at a time

A server that handles one client at a time is called single-threaded, or
single-threaded server.

A single-threaded server is quite simple to implement:

1. It creates a socket to listen for incoming connections.
2. When a connection is accepted, it creates a socket to communicate with the
   client.
3. It then reads the data sent by the client and sends a response.

The main drawback of a single-threaded server is that it can only handle one
client at a time. If another client tries to connect, it will have to wait until
the first client is disconnected.

An analogy is to think of a single-threaded server as a restaurant with only one
table. If a customer is already sitting at the table, another customer will have
to wait until the first customer leaves.

A single-threaded server is therefore not suitable for production. It is
suitable for testing and learning purposes. In order to manage multiple clients,
a server must handle multiple sockets.

Multiple ways exist to handle multiple sockets at the same time and is called
concurrency.

## Handling multiple clients with concurrency

Concurrency is the ability of an application to handle multiple clients at the
same time.

There are multiple ways to handle multiple clients with concurrency (among
others):

- Multi-processing
- Multi-threading
- Asynchronous programming

Java has a package for concurrency called
[`java.util.concurrent`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html).

In this course, we will focus on multi-threading but the other methods are
equally valid and interesting to learn.

### Multi-processing

Multi-processing is the ability of an application to handle multiple processes
at the same time.

A process is a program in execution. It is identified by a process ID.

A process has its own memory space. It cannot access the memory space of another
process.

The main process is the process that is created when the application starts.

It creates other processes to handle multiple clients.

A process is a heavy-weight object. It is quite expensive to create and destroy
as it is a copy of the main process.

Processes can communicate with each other using inter-process communication
(IPC) but it is quite complex to implement.

An analogy is to think of a process as restaurant chain with multiple
restaurant. Each restaurant has only one table and can handle one customer. If a
customer is already sitting at a table of a given restaurant, another customer
can sit at a table at another restaurant.

### Multi-threading

Multi-threading is the ability of an application to handle multiple threads at
the same time.

A thread is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of the
main thread.

The main thread is the thread that is created when the application starts.

It creates other threads to handle multiple clients.

Each thread has its own stack and its own program counter.

A thread is therefore quite similar to a process, except that it shares the same
memory space as the other threads. It is therefore much cheaper to create and
destroy than a process (but still more expensive than a simple object).

Threads can communicate with each other using shared memory.

Threads are more lightweight than processes but their number is limited by the
operating system.

There are two ways to manage threads:

- Unlimited threads
- Thread pool that limits the number of threads

When discussing the unlimited threads approach, an analogy is to think of a
restaurant with no tables at all. When a new customer arrives, the restaurant
manager adds a new table for the customer. Each table can handle one customer.

Using this approach, the more customers arrive, the more tables are added. This
approach is not suitable for production as space and resources are limited.

When discussing the thread pool approach, an analogy is to think of a restaurant
with a limited number of tables. When a new customer arrives, the restaurant
manager checks if a table is available. If a table is available, the customer
can sit at the table. If no table is available, the customer will have to wait
until a table is available.

Using this approach, the number of tables is limited. This approach is suitable
for production as space and resources are managed and limited.

### Asynchronous programming

Asynchronous programming is the ability of an application to handle multiple
tasks at the same time, without blocking the main thread.

Using asynchronous programming, the main thread can perform other tasks while
waiting for a task to complete.

Asynchronous programming is based on the concept of callbacks. A callback is a
function that is called when a task is completed.

An analogy is to think of asynchronous programming as a food truck without any
tables. Once a customer wants something to eat, the person managing the food
truck gives the customer a ticket. The customer then waits until the food is
ready but can do other things in the meantime.

Once the food is ready, the person managing the food truck calls the customer.
The customer then comes to the food truck to get the food.

Asynchronous programming is quite complex to implement. It is therefore not
covered in this course.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is a good example of asynchronous programming.
