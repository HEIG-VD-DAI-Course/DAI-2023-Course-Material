# Practical work 1

<https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course>

[Markdown][markdown] Â· [PDF][pdf]

L. Delafontaine and H. Louis, with the help of Copilot.

This work is licensed under the [CC BY-SA 4.0][license] license.

We use CLI tools every day. For example, we use `git` to manage our code, `mvn`
to build our projects, `java` to run our programs, etc.

In this practical work, you will create a CLI using
[picocli](https://picocli.info/) to process files.

The CLI will take an input file and an output file as arguments. It will also
take optional arguments such as the input file encoding and the output file
encoding (the default will be UTF-8 for example). The CLI will process the input
file and write the result in the output file. It will display a message on
success and a message on failure.

You have the freedom to define what the CLI will do. You can be creative! For
example, you can choose to transform the the input text file to the output text
file (uppercase/lowercase/find/replace/count number of words/etc.), to convert a
PNG to JPEG, add metadata to existing TIFF files, etc. If you do not have any
idea, come to see us and we can give you some ideas.

Multiple groups can choose the same processing and you can share your
methodology but please do not copy/paste code from other groups.

## Objectives

- Create a CLI to process files
- Use Java IOs to process files with different encodings
- Make usage of a Maven dependency

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do
not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2023-2024 - Practical work 1 - First name Last name member 1
  and First name Last name member 2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

## Constraints

- The CLI application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 17
- The CLI application must be built using Maven
- You must use one or more of the Java IOs classes seen in the course
- Your application must be slightly more complex and different than the ones
  presented during the course

## Remarks

Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Silly! Sometimes it is better to
use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your implementation is too complex, we might penalize you.

You can use any other dependencies you want in your Maven project. You must
however explain why and how you use it in your README.

You can protect the `main` branch of your repository to prevent any push on it
and force signed commits from team members. This will force all team members to
use signed pull requests to merge your work.

## Submission

The planning of the course is available at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/projects>. The **deadline** is just
**before the Practical work review and feedback session**.

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay
will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the latest commit hash
  of your work before submission

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
