## Objectives

This chapter will help you understand why IOs are important in network
programming and how to use them in Java.

Network programming is about reading and writing data (= files) from and to the
network. Files are a great example to understand how IOs work in the first place
without the hassle of network programming.

You might need to use different types of IOs depending on the type of data you
want to process. You will learn how to use the right IOs for the right data.

As this chapter is quite abstract, you will first setup your environment to be
able to run some code examples along with the theory.

These skills are essential to be able to process data from the network later on
this course!

Let's get started!

## Prepare and setup your environment

### Check and run the code examples

In this section, you will clone the code examples repository to check and run
the code examples along with the theory.

#### Clone the repository

Clone the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository to get the code examples.

#### Access the code examples in your terminal

Open a terminal and navigate to the `heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`
directory.

As a quick reminder, these commands can help you to navigate in the terminal:

- `ls` to list the files and directories in the current directory
- `cd directory` to navigate to the `directory` directory
- `cd ..` to navigate to the parent directory
- `pwd` to print the current directory
- `clear` to clear the terminal
- `exit` to exit the terminal

#### Explore and run the code examples

In the `05-java-ios` directory, checkout the `README.md` file to learn how to
run the code examples.

As a quick reminder, you can run the code examples using the following command:

```bash
# Compile the code example
javac HelloWorld.java

# Run the code example
java HelloWorld
```

You now have everything you need to run the code examples. Let's dive into the
theory!

## Sources, streams and sinks of data

Whenever you deal with data, you need to read data from a source and write it to
a destination.

A representation of this process is called a **stream**.

A **stream** is a way to read or write data from a **source** to a **sink**.

A **source of data** is **where the data comes from**. It can be a file, a
network connection, a keyboard, etc. A common term for a source of data is
something that **produces** data (**a producer**).

A **sink of data** is **where the data goes**. It can be another file, a network
connection, a screen, etc. A common term for a sink of data is something that
**consumes** data (**a consumer**).

A **stream** is **a way to read or write data** from a source to a sink.

## The Java IO API

The [Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/) is
separated in modules. The Java IO API is part of the `java.base` module.

In the `java.base` module, there are two main packages to read and write data:

- `java.io`: the standard Java IO API
- `java.nio`: the Java NIO API

The `java.io` package is called **Java IO API** or the **standard Java IO API**.

The **Java NIO API** was introduced in Java 1.4. It is a more modern API that
can be more efficient and more flexible than the Java IO API in some use-case.
It is also more complex to use and is meant for more advanced use cases (writing
scalable servers for example). We will not cover this API in this course.

## Processing binary data with the Java IO API

Binary data processing is the most basic type of data processing: you open a
file, you read the bits and you write the bits to another file. You do not have
to interpret the bits, you just copy them.

### Reading binary data

When you read binary data, you read the bits as they are stored in the file.

The most simple way to read binary data is byte by byte.

This is done using the `InputStream` class. The `InputStream` class is an
abstract class that is the superclass of all classes representing an input
stream of bytes.

Open the `BinaryReadFileExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios` directory to see
how to read binary data byte by byte.

The following line opens a file for reading binary data. It will attempt to open
the file `binary-file.bin` in the current directory:

```java
InputStream fis = new FileInputStream("binary-file.bin");
```

As this file is not yet created, the program will throw a
`FileNotFoundException` exception if you try to execute the program. This is
normal. You will create this file and run the program later.

The following line reads data from the file byte by byte:

```java
// -1 indicates the end of the file
int b;
while ((b = fis.read()) != -1) {
  System.out.print(b);
}
```

Each `read()` call will read one byte from the file. The `read()` method returns
the byte read as an `int`. If the end of the file is reached, the `read()`
method will return `-1`.

The following line closes the file:

```java
fis.close();
```

This is important to close the file after you have read the data. If you do not
close the file, you might lose data or corrupt the file as other processes might
not be able to access the file.

Compile and execute the `BinaryReadFileExample.java` file. This will throw a
`FileNotFoundException` exception as the file `binary-file.bin` does not yet
exist.

Continue to the next section to see how to create this file.

### Writing binary data

When you write binary data, you write the bits as they are stored in the file.

The most simple way to write binary data is byte by byte.

This is done using the `OutputStream` class. The `OutputStream` class is an
abstract class that is the superclass of all classes representing an output
stream of bytes.

Open the `BinaryWriteFileExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios` directory to
see how to write binary data byte by byte.

The following line opens a file for writing binary data. It will attempt to open
the file `binary-file.bin` in the current directory:

```java
OutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("binary-file.bin");
```

The following line writes data to the file byte by byte:

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
  fos.write(i);
}
```

Each `write()` call will write one byte to the file.

The following line closes the file:

```java
fis.close();
```

This is important to close the file after you have read the data. If you do not
close the file, you might lose data or corrupt the file as other processes might
not be able to access the file.

Compile and execute the `BinaryWriteFileExample.java` file. This will create the
file `binary-file.bin` in the current directory.

Compile and execute the `BinaryReadFileExample.java` file. This will read the
content of the file `binary-file.bin` and print the file content to the console.

### Reading and writing binary data with a buffer

When you read or write binary data byte by byte, each `read()` or `write()` call
will issue a system call to read or write one byte from or to the file. This is
not efficient.

To improve the performance, you can use a buffer. A buffer is a temporary memory
space where you can store data before reading or writing it to the file.

This is done using the `BufferedInputStream` and `BufferedOutputStream` classes.

The `BufferedInputStream` class is a subclass of the `InputStream` class that
adds buffering to the input stream. The `BufferedOutputStream` class is a
subclass of the `OutputStream` class that adds buffering to the output stream.

Open the `BinaryBufferReadFileExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios` directory
to see how to read binary data with a buffer.

Here are the changes between the `BinaryReadFileExample.java` file and the
`BinaryBufferReadFileExample.java` file:

```diff
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
     InputStream fis = new FileInputStream("binary-file.bin");
+    InputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);

     // -1 indicates the end of the file
     int b;
-    while ((b = fis.read()) != -1) {
+    while ((b = bis.read()) != -1) {
       System.out.print(b);
     }

+    bis.close();
     fis.close();
   }
```

The `BufferedInputStream` class is created with the `FileInputStream` class as
an argument. The `BufferedInputStream` class will read data from the
`FileInputStream` class and store it in a buffer.

The `BufferedInputStream` class will read data from the buffer instead of
reading data from the file directly. This is more efficient as the buffer can
store more data than the `FileInputStream` class can read in one system call.

Compile and execute the `BinaryBufferReadFileExample.java` file. This will read
the content of the file `binary-file.bin` and print the file content to the
console.

Open the `BinaryBufferWriteFileExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios` directory
to see how to write binary data with a buffer.

Here are the changes between the `BinaryWriteFileExample.java` file and the
`BinaryBufferWriteFileExample.java` file:

```diff
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
     OutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("binary-file.bin");
+    BufferedOutputStream bos = new BufferedOutputStream(fos);

     for (int i = 0; i < 256; i++) {
-      fos.write(i);
+      bos.write(i);
     }

+    // Flush the buffer to write the remaining bytes as the buffer may not be full
+    bos.flush();
+    bos.close();
     fos.close();
   }
```

The `BufferedOutputStream` class is created with the `FileOutputStream` class as
an argument. The `BufferedOutputStream` class will write data to the
`FileOutputStream` class and store it in a buffer.

The `BufferedOutputStream` class will write data to the buffer instead of
writing data to the file directly. This is more efficient as the buffer can
store more data than the `FileOutputStream` class can write in one system call.

The `flush()` method is called to write the remaining bytes in the buffer to the
file. This is important to call the `flush()` method to make sure that all data
is written to the file.

Compile and execute the `BinaryBufferWriteFileExample.java` file. This will
create the file `binary-file.bin` in the current directory.

Compile and execute the `BinaryBufferReadFileExample.java` file. This will read
the content of the file `binary-file.bin` and print the file content to the
console.

### A quick note on little endian vs. big endian

When working with binary data, you need to know if the data is encoded in
**little endian** or in **big endian**.

**Little endian** means that the least significant byte is stored first. **Big
endian** means that the most significant byte is stored first.

For example, the number `0x12345678` is stored as `0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12` in
little endian and as `0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78` in big endian.

This is important to know when you read or write binary data. If you read or
write binary data in the wrong endian, the data will be corrupted.

Java uses big endian by default. You can use little endian by using the
`ByteBuffer` class. We will not cover this in this course.

## Processing text data with the Java IO API

While binary data processing is quite simple, text data processing is more
complex.

When you read text data, you need to interpret the bits to get the characters.

When you write text data, you need to encode the characters to bits.

To better understand text data processing, you need to understand character
encodings.

### Ancestor of character representations: ASCII

The **American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)** is one of the
first character encodings. It is a character encoding that maps 128 binary
values to 128 characters. For example, the binary data `01000001` is mapped to
the character `A`.

The first implementation of ASCII was published in 1963. It was meant to be used
for the English language only. It was later extended to support other languages.

### Extended ASCII: codes pages

As ASCII is a very limited character encoding (only 8 bits, leaving 128 other
possible values), many other character encodings were created to support more
characters and languages.

These extended ASCII character encodings are called **code pages**. They were
then standardized by the **International Organization for Standardization
(ISO)**.

Common code pages are **ISO-8859-1** (also called **Latin-1**), **ISO-8859-15**
(also called **Latin-9**), **Windows-1252** (also called **CP1252**), etc.

### Unicode

**Unicode** is a newer character encoding standard that was meant to **solve the
issues of ASCII and code pages** that could not support all specificities of all
languages:

- Languages with more than 256 characters (like Chinese)
- Languages with more than one alphabet (like Serbian)
- Languages with more than one writing system (like Chinese or Japanese)

The Unicode specification defines 1,112,064 characters.

This is enough to **support all languages in the world** as well as emojis (for
our greatest pleasure... ð¥²).

Implementations of the Unicode standard are called **Unicode Transformation
Formats (UTF)**. The most common implementations is **UTF-8**.

### UTF-8

**UTF-8** is a variable-length character encoding that uses 1 to 4 bytes to
encode a character. It is the most common implementation of the Unicode
standard. It is the default character encoding on the Internet and many other
applications.

UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII. This means that if you have a file
encoded in ASCII, it is also encoded in UTF-8.

The following table shows how a character is encoded in UTF-8 depending on the
number of bytes used:

| Binary data                                 | Meaning           |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `0xxxxxxx`                                  | 1 byte character  |
| `110xxxxx` `10xxxxxx`                       | 2 bytes character |
| `1110xxxx` `10xxxxxx` `10xxxxxx`            | 3 bytes character |
| `11110xxx` `10xxxxxx` `10xxxxxx` `10xxxxxx` | 4 bytes character |

As some bits are used to encode the length of the character, the number of
possible characters is limited, hence the 1,112,064 characters limit.

Other implementations of the Unicode standard exist, such as UTF-16 and UTF-32.
They are not as common as UTF-8 and are not backward compatible with ASCII.

Java strings for instance uses UTF-16, meaning a character is encoded in 2 bytes
(in C/C++, a character is encoded in 1 byte).

### What happens if you ignore the character encoding?

When you open a file, you need to know the character encoding that was used to
encode the file.

The character encoding is not usually stored in the file. You need to know it in
advance to be able to read the file correctly.

When the character encoding is not known in advance or misinterpreted, it can
lead to issues like displaying the wrong characters or not being able to display
the characters at all.

A good example is when you open a text file encoded in UTF-8 with a text editor
that does not support UTF-8. The text editor will try to interpret the file as
ASCII and will display the wrong characters (`ÃÂ©` instead of `Ã©` for example).

Open the `TextCharacterEncodingsExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios`
directory to see how to encode and decode characters with different character
encodings.

Compile and execute the `TextCharacterEncodingsExample.java` file. This will
print the word "student" encoded in different character encodings for different
languages.

Notice that the word "student" is encoded in different ways depending on the
character encoding used. This is because the character encoding defines how the
characters are encoded in bits.

If you do not set the character encoding when you read or write text data, the
default character encoding will be used. This is not what you want as the file
might be encoded in a different character encoding and all systems might not be
able to read the file correctly.

### Reading and writing text data

When you read and write text data, you need to know the character encoding used
to encode the text data.

This is done using the `Reader` and `Writer` classes. The `Reader` class is an
abstract class that is the superclass of all classes representing an input
stream of characters. The `Writer` class is an abstract class that is the
superclass of all classes representing an output stream of characters.

Open the `TextReadFileExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios` directory to see
how to read and write text data.

The following line opens a file for reading text data. It will attempt to open
the file `TextReadAndWriteFileExample.java` (the current file) in the current
directory:

```java
Reader reader = new FileReader("TextReadAndWriteFileExample.java", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

Notice that the character encoding is set to `UTF-8`. This is important to set
the character encoding when you read or write text data. If you do not set the
character encoding, the default character encoding will be used, which is not
what you want as it can differ from other systems.

The following line opens a file for writing text data. It will attempt to open
the file `TextReadAndWriteFileExample.txt` in the current directory:

```java
Writer writer = new FileWriter("TextReadAndWriteFileExample.txt", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
```

The following line reads data from the file byte by byte and writes it to the
output file:

```java
// -1 indicates the end of the file
int c;
while ((c = reader.read()) != -1) {
  writer.write(c);
}
```

Just as with binary data, each character is read and written byte by byte.

The following line closes the file:

```java
writer.close();
reader.close();
```

Just as with binary data, reading and writing text data byte by byte is not
efficient. You can use a buffer to read and write text data more efficiently.

Open the `TextBufferReadAndWriteFileExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios`
directory to see how to read and write text data with a buffer.

Here are the changes between the `TextReadFileExample.java` file and the
`TextBufferReadAndWriteFileExample.java` file:

```diff
   public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
     Reader reader = new FileReader("TextReadAndWriteFileExample.java", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
+    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(reader);
+
     Writer writer = new FileWriter("TextReadAndWriteFileExample.txt", StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
+    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(writer);

     // -1 indicates the end of the file
     int c;
-    while ((c = reader.read()) != -1) {
-      writer.write(c);
+    while ((c = br.read()) != -1) {
+      bw.write(c);
     }

+    writer.flush();
     writer.close();
     reader.close();
   }
```

The `BufferedReader` class is created with the `FileReader` class as an
argument. The `BufferedReader` class will read data from the `FileReader` class
and store it in a buffer.

The `BufferedReader` class will read data from the buffer instead of reading
data from the file directly. This is more efficient as the buffer can store more
data than the `FileReader` class can read in one system call.

The `BufferedWriter` class is created with the `FileWriter` class as an
argument. The `BufferedWriter` class will write data to the `FileWriter` class
and store it in a buffer.

The `BufferedWriter` class will write data to the buffer instead of writing data
to the file directly. This is more efficient as the buffer can store more data
than the `FileWriter` class can write in one system call.

The `flush()` method is called to write the remaining bytes in the buffer to the
file. This is important to call the `flush()` method to make sure that all data
is written to the file.

Compile and execute the `TextBufferReadAndWriteFileExample.java` file. This will
read the content of the file `TextReadAndWriteFileExample.java` and write the
file content to the file `TextReadAndWriteFileExample.txt`.

### End of line characters

Another important thing to know when dealing with text files is the **end of
line character**.

The end of line character is a special character that marks the end of a line.

There are different end of line characters depending on the operating system:

- Unix/Linux/macOS: `'\n'`, called _"Line feed"_ (`LF`)
- Windows: `'\r\n'`, called _"Carriage Return + Line feed"_ (`CR`+`LF`)

When you read a text file line by line, the string you get will **not** contain
the end of line character(s).

When you write a string to a file, you have to add the end of line character(s)
yourself if you want to write a new line.

Open the `TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios`
directory to see how to read and write text data with end of line characters.

The following line opens a file for writing text data. It will attempt to open
the file `TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.java` (the current file) in the current
directory:

```java
InputStream is = new FileInputStream("TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.java");
Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(is, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(reader);
```

Notice that this time, the class `InputStreamReader` is used to read the file
with the `UTF-8` character encoding. It opens the file using a `FileInputStream`
class as binary data and decodes the binary data to text data using the `UTF-8`
character encoding. It then uses a `BufferedReader` class to read the text data
with a buffer.

The following line opens a file for writing text data. It will attempt to open
the file `TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.txt` in the current directory:

```java
OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("LineEndingsExample.txt");
Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(os, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(writer);
```

Notice that this time, the class `OutputStreamWriter` is used to write the file
with the `UTF-8` character encoding. It opens the file using a
`FileOutputStream` class as binary data and encodes the text data to binary data
using the `UTF-8` character encoding. It then uses a `BufferedWriter` class to
write the binary data with a buffer.

The following line reads data from the file line by line and writes it to the
output file with the end of line character:

```java
String line;
while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
  // Careful: line does not contain end-of-line characters
  bw.write(line + END_OF_LINE);
}
```

The `readLine()` method reads a line from the file. The line does not contain
the end of line character(s). You have to add the end of line character(s)
yourself if you want to write a new line.

Compile and execute the `TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.java` file. This will
read the content of the file `TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.java` and write the
file content to the file `TextEndOfLineCharactersExample.txt` with the end of
line character(s).

While the `System.lineSeparator()` method returns the end of line character(s)
for the current operating system, it is better to set a constant for the end of
line character(s) in your program. This way, you can control the end of line
character(s) and make sure that the file is written correctly for all systems.

### Dealing with errors

When using the Java IO API, you need to open and close a file before and after
reading or writing data.

If you do not close the file properly, you might lose data or corrupt the file.

When accessing a file, many things can go wrong. The file might not exist, the
file might be corrupted, the file might be locked by another process, etc.

When you open a file, you need to handle these errors. You can do this by
catching the `IOException` exception. This is done with a `try-catch-finally`
block or, more recently, with a `try-with-resources` block.

Using the `try-with-resources` block is the preferred way to handle errors as it
is more concise and less error-prone, however, the class must implement the
[`AutoCloseable`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html)
interface.

The common exceptions you might encounter are:

- `FileNotFoundException`: the file does not exist
- `IOException`: the file cannot be accessed for other reasons
- `UnsupportedEncodingException`: the file is encoded in an unsupported
  character encoding

The same applies when you will use the network: the network might be down, the
connection might be lost, etc.

You will have to manage these errors when you will work with the network.

Open the `DealingWithErrorsExample.java` file in the `05-java-ios` directory to
see how to handle errors when reading and writing data.

Take some time to read the code and understand how to handle errors when reading
and writing data.

## When to use which IO?

The Java IO API is very powerful. It can be used to read and write data from and
to different sources and sinks of data using different types of streams.

It can sometimes be overwhelming to know which IO to use for which use case.

Here is a simple decision tree to help you choose the right IO for the right use
case:

![Decision tree to choose the right IO for the right use case](./images/when-to-use-which-io.png)

## Common pitfalls

When using the Java IO API, you need to set the character encoding when you read
or write text data. If you do not set the character encoding, the default
character encoding will be used, which is not what you want.

When using the Java IO API, you need to open and close a file before and after
reading or writing data.

The class `PrintWriter` is a subclass of the `Writer` class that is used to
write text data. It is a very useful class to write text data as it provides
many convenience methods to write text data. However, it does not handle errors
properly as it does not throw exceptions when an error occurs. It is better to
use the `BufferedWriter` class to write text data.

The `System.lineSeparator()` method returns the end of line character(s) for the
current operating system. As it is a system-dependent property, it is better to
set a constant for the end of line character(s) in your program.

## Practical content

In this practical content, you will use all the knowledge you have learned in
this chapter to benchmark the different types of streams.

You will learn how to read and write data from and to different sources and
sinks of data using different types of streams and benchmark the different types
of streams to see which one is the most efficient for different use cases.

### Create and clone the repository

You can create a new GitHub project using the template we have prepared for you.
When you create a new repository, you can choose to use a template. Select the
`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-java-ios-practical-content` template as
shown in the following screenshot:

> [!WARNING]
>
> Please make sure that the repository owner is your personal GitHub account and
> not the `heig-vd-dai-course` organization.

![Create the new repository from the template](./images/practical-content-create-and-clone-the-repository.png)

Clone the repository locally.

### Implement the different types of streams

Take some time to explore the codebase from the template we have prepared for
you.

You will benchmark the different types of streams to see which one is the most
efficient for your use case:

- Open a binary file for byte per byte reading
- Write a binary file for byte per byte writing
- Open a binary file for buffer reading
- Write a binary file for buffer writing
- Open a text file for byte per byte reading
- Write a text file for byte per byte writing
- Open a text file for buffer reading
- Write a text file for buffer writing

You will then execute your CLI tool to write data of a certain size and read
them back to compare the execution time.

Read the course material carefully to find the right classes to use. You can
also have a look at the Java documentation to find more details on the right
classes to use and how to use them:
<https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/>.

### Compare the results

Generate different files with different sizes (1B, 1KiB, 1MiB, 5MiB). Compare
the results with the execution time of the different types of streams. Which one
is the most efficient for each use case?

### Share your results

Share your results in the GitHub Discussions of this organization:
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions>.

Create a new discussion with the following information:

- **Title**: DAI 2024-2025 - Java IOs benchmarking - First name Last Name
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: The link to your GitHub repository, the results of your
  benchmarking in Markdown table and add your conclusions to the following
  questions:
  - Which type of stream is the most efficient for each use case?
  - Why is it more efficient than the other types of streams?
  - What is the difference between binary data and text data?
  - What is a character encoding?
  - Why is this methodology important?

This will notify us that you have completed the exercise and we can check your
work.

You can compare your solution with the official one stated in the
[Solution](#solution) section, however, **we highly recommend you to try to
complete the practical content by yourself first to learn the most**.

### Go further

This is an optional section. Feel free to skip it if you do not have time.

- You can do the same benchmarking with the Java NIO API. How is it different
  from the Java IO API?

## Conclusion

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have learned how to read and write data from and to
different sources and sinks of data using different types of streams, more
specifically binary and text data.

You have learned the importance of character encodings and how to handle them
when reading and writing data.

You have learned how to benchmark the different types of streams to find the
most efficient one for your use case.

You have also learned how to handle errors to avoid your program to crash and
leave the files in an inconsistent state.

### Test your knowledge

At this point, you should be able to answer the following questions:

- What is a source of data?
- What is a sink of data?
- What is a stream?
- What is the difference between binary data and text data?
- What is a character encoding?
- What is UTF-8? How is it different from ASCII and Unicode?
- What happens if you ignore the character encoding?
- How is a buffer more efficient than reading or writing byte by byte?

## Finished? Was it easy? Was it hard?
