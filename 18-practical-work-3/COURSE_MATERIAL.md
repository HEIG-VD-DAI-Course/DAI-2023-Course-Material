# Practical work 3

Network applications are everywhere. They are used to communicate, to play
games, to watch videos, to listen to music, to browse the web, to send emails,
etc.

In this practical work, you will create a network application that uses the UDP
protocol.

The network application will be defined by an application protocol, a client and
a server. The client will send a request to the server and the server will send
a response to the client.

The application protocol will be defined by you. You can decide to create your
own little application protocol or you can implement an existing protocol.

Your application must be built around UDP. You can use TCP but it should not be
the core of your application. The main difference between TCP and UDP is that
TCP is reliable and UDP is not, having more challenges. UDP is faster than TCP
because it does not have to wait for acknowledgments. It can be used in
real-time communication applications and discovery protocols.

Feel free to be creative! For example, you can choose to create a chat
application, a game, a file transfer application, etc. If you do not have any
idea, come to see us and we can give you.

## Objectives

- Define a network application protocol
- Make usage of the UDP protocol
- Use Java UDP programming to implement a client and a server application
- Use Docker and Docker Compose to deploy the client and the server

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do
not have a partner, we will assign you one. In this practical work, you have to
work with someone else.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2023-2024 - Practical work 3 - First name Last name member 1
  and First name Last name member 2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

## Constraints

- The network application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 17
- The network application must be built using Maven
- Your application must be slightly more complex and different than the ones presented during the course
- The network application can only use the UDP protocol
- You must build and release the application using Docker and Docker Compose

## Remarks

Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Silly! Sometimes it is better to
use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your implementation is too complex, we might penalize you.

If elements that are supposed to be acquired through the course or previous
practical works are omitted, forgotten or poorly implemented, we might penalize
you.

You can use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), [Draw.io](https://draw.io/) or
any other tools you want to create your sequence diagrams.

You can use any other dependencies you want in your Maven project. You must
however explain why and how you use it in your README.

You can protect the `main` branch of your repository to prevent any push on it
and force signed commits from team members. This will force all team members to
use signed pull requests to merge your work.

## Submission

The planning of the course is available at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/projects>. The **deadline** is just
**before the Practical work review and feedback session**.

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay
will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the latest commit hash
  of your work before submission

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
