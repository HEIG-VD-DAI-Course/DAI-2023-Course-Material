[Introduction and course organization](./01-introduction-and-course-organization/README.md)!

## Course planning and material

This course is equivalent to 3 ECTS credits = ~75-90 hours of work.

- 48 hours in class (= 64 periods of 45 minutes)
- ~27-42 hours outside of the class - We try our best to ensure you do not have
  to work that much outside of the class

64 periods in class are planned for this course, divided in 3 main parts:

- [Part 1 - Input/output processing (18 periods)](#part-1---inputoutput-processing-18-periods)
- [Part 2 - Network programming with TCP and UDP (24 periods)](#part-2---network-programming-with-tcp-and-udp-24-periods)
- [Part 3 - Network programming with HTTP (20 periods)](#part-3---network-programming-with-http-20-periods)

The entire course planning for the semester is available at
