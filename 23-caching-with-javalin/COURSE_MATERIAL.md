## Objectives

In this chapter, you will learn how to build a web infrastructure.

You will learn how to use a reverse proxy and a load balancer to scale your
system.

Thanks to HTTP features, the reverse proxy will be able to serve multiple
domains on the same IP address.

You will also learn how to use caching to improve the performance of your
system.

Finally, you will learn how to monitor your system and how to calculate the
number of servers needed to handle a certain amount of requests.

## Prepare and setup your environment

### Access your `hosts` file

In this section, you will access your `hosts` file.

The host file is a computer file used by an operating system to map hostnames to
IP addresses. The hosts file is a plain text file and is conventionally named
`hosts`. The hosts file can be used as an alternative to (or in conjunction
with) DNS.

On Unix-like operating systems (Linux and macOS), the hosts file is located at
`/etc/hosts`.

On Windows, the hosts file is located at `%WinDir%\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts`.

Ensure you can access your `hosts` file and edit it for the next steps.

### Traefik

In this section, you will install and configure
[Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) using its official Docker image available
on Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/_/traefik>.

Traefik is an open-source Edge Router that makes exposing/publishing your
services on the Internet a fun and easy experience. It receives requests on
behalf of your system and finds out which components are responsible for
handling them.

Traefik is full of features and can be used as a reverse proxy, a load balancer,
a Kubernetes ingress controller, and much more.

One of the main features of Traefik is to issue and renew
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) (HTTPS) certificates automatically in
conjuncture with
[Docker Compose labels](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#labels).

We will go into more details about Traefik in the next sections.

Run the `traefik-insecure` example from the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Read the README carefully. Take some time to explore the code, it
should contain comments to help you understand what is going on.

You should be able to access the Traefik dashboard at <http://localhost:8080>
and <http://traefik.localhost>.

## Functional and non-functional requirements

Functional and non-functional requirements are used to define the scope of a
system.

It is an abstract representation of the system that will be implemented and that
can help to define the architecture of the system.

Functional requirements are the features that a system must have to satisfy the
needs of its users. It is the "what" of a system.

Some examples of functional requirements:

- **User management**: Users must be able to register, login, logout, etc.
- **Product management**: Users must be able to create, read, update, delete
  products, etc.
- **Order management**: Users must be able to create, read, update, delete
  orders, etc.
- **Payment management**: Users must be able to pay for their orders, etc.

In order to provide the features that a system must have, the system must
respect some constraints. These constraints are called non-functional
requirements.

Some examples of non-functional requirements:

- **Response time**: Time required between a request and the presentation of the
  result (most important for the end user)
- **Throughput**: Number of requests handled per time interval (most important
  for the service provider)
- **Scalability**: Property of a system to handle a varying amount of work -
  ideally we want linear scalability: 2x more server for 2x more users
- **Availability**: Percentage of time that the system provides a satisfactory
  service
- **Maintainability**: Ease with which the system can be managed and evolved
- **Security**: Confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication,
  authorization, etc.
- ...and many, many more:
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement>

Functional and non-functional requirements are used to define the scope of a
system and they strongly depend on/influence the architecture of a system.

It is important to define the functional and non-functional requirements of a
system before starting to design it.

Implementing all requirements is not always possible. Some requirements can be
in conflict with each other. For example, increasing the security of a system
can decrease its performance.

It is always a trade-off between the requirements.

## Web infrastructure definition

Caching with Javalin are the software and hardware resources that are used to
support the deployment of web applications, web services, and websites on the
Internet that respect the functional and non-functional requirements of the
system.

Caching with Javalin are composed of several components:

- **Web server**: a computer that runs web server software and responds to
  requests from a web client (e.g. a web browser, a mobile application, a
  command line tool, etc.)
- **Reverse proxy**: a proxy server that retrieves resources on behalf of a
  client from one or more servers. These resources are then returned to the
  client as though they originated from the proxy server itself.
- **Load balancer**: a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes
  network or application traffic across a number of servers.
- **Cache**: a component that stores data so future requests for that data can
  be served faster.
- **Content delivery network (CDN)**: a geographically distributed network of
  proxy servers and their data centers.

In this chapter, we will explore a few of these components and how they can be
used to build a web infrastructure.

## The `Host` header

Thanks to the HTTP protocol, Caching with Javalin can be built easily. HTTP
offers many features that can be used to build a web infrastructure.

One of the feature HTTP offers is the `Host` header.

The `Host` header is a header which specifies the domain name of the server. It
is a header sent by the client.

Using this header, a server can handle multiple domains on the same IP address
with the help of a reverse proxy.

Before the `Host` header, a server could only handle one domain per IP address.
The following diagram shows how it worked:

![HTTP without the Host header](./images/http-without-the-host-header.png)

The following PlantUML diagram shows how the `Host` header works:

![HTTP with the Host header](./images/http-with-the-host-header.png)

The reverse proxy receives the request from the client and forwards it to the
web server. The web server receives the request and sends a response to the
reverse proxy. The reverse proxy receives the response and forwards it to the
client.

## Forward proxy and reverse proxy

Forward and reverse proxies are two different types of proxies.

A proxy is a component that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients
seeking resources from other servers.

### Forward proxy

As described in
[Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy: The Difference Explained](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/difference-between-proxy-and-reverse-proxy)
article, a forward proxy...

> ...also known as a proxy server, operates between clients and external
> systems, regulating traffic, masking client IP addresses, and enforcing
> security policies.

It acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from
other servers. A forward proxy is a proxy configured to handle requests from a
group of clients to any other server.

Forward proxies are often used in corporate environments to enforce security
policies (e.g. block access to certain websites, etc.) and resides in the LAN
network.

![Forward proxy](./images/forward-proxy.png)

### Reverse proxy

As described in
[Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy: The Difference Explained](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/difference-between-proxy-and-reverse-proxy)
article, a reverse proxy...

> ...is positioned between clients and servers, acting as a protective barrier
> for servers by accepting client requests, forwarding them to the appropriate
> server, and returning the results to the client.

It acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from
other servers. A reverse proxy is a proxy configured to handle requests from any
client to a group of servers.

Reverse proxies are often used in Caching with Javalin to serve multiple domains
on the same IP address and to scale.

![Reverse proxy](./images/reverse-proxy.png)

Reverse proxies are used in Caching with Javalin to serve multiple domains on
the same IP address and to scale.

A reverse proxy is a component that sits in front of one or more servers. It
receives requests from clients and forwards them to the servers. It also
receives responses from the servers and forwards them back to the clients.

A reverse proxy can be used to:

- **Load balance**: Reverse proxy can receive all traffic and distribute the
  requests on a cluster of several identical Web server instances
- **Cache**: Reverse proxy can keep in cache responses from servers for a
  certain amount of time - if the same request is received again, the reverse
  proxy can return the cached response instead of forwarding the request to the
  server
- **Encrypt** and **decrypt** traffic: Reverse proxy manages secure HTTPS
  connections with clients and unsecure HTTP connections with servers
- **Protect** servers from attacks (e.g. DDoS, SQL injection, etc.): By
  filtering requests, reverse proxy can protect servers from attacks
- **Serve static content** (e.g. images, videos, etc.): Reverse proxy can serve
  static content from a cache
- **Serve multiple domains** on the same IP address: Reverse proxy can use the
  `Host` header to forward requests to the correct server

A reverse proxy is a very powerful component that can be used to build a web
infrastructure.

Run the `whoami-with-traefik-pathprefix-rule` example from the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Read the README carefully. Take some time to explore the code, it
should contain comments to help you understand what is going on.

You should be able to access whoami at <http://localhost/whoami>.

The output should be similar to the following:

```text
Hostname: 629ffa2f25bd
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.26.0.3

X-Forwarded-Proto: http
X-Forwarded-Server: 880dafe26d2a
X-Real-Ip: 192.168.65.1
```

Note the following headers:

- `Hostname`: the domain name of the whoami container
- `IP`: the IP addresses of the whoami container
- `GET /whoami HTTP/1.1`: the HTTP request from the client
- `Host: localhost`: the domain name requested by the client
- `X-Forwarded-For`: the IP address of the client
- `X-Forwarded-Host`: the domain name of the client
- `X-Forwarded-Port`: the port of the client
- `X-Forwarded-Proto`: the protocol of the client
- `X-Forwarded-Server`: the hostname of the reverse proxy container

Using both the `Host` header, the HTTP request and the `X-Forwarded-*` headers,
the reverse proxy can forward the request to the correct server (whoami
container).

The request from the client has been forwarded to the reverse proxy. The reverse
proxy has forwarded the request to the whoami container. The whoami container
has sent a response to the reverse proxy. The reverse proxy has forwarded the
response to the client.

Now, run the `whoami-with-traefik-host-rule` example from the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Read the README carefully. Take some time to explore the code, it
should contain comments to help you understand what is going on.

You should be able to access whoami at <http://whoami.localhost>.

Same as before, but this time, the reverse proxy has mapped the
`whoami.localhost` domain to the whoami container.

Now, run the `whoami-with-traefik-host-and-pathprefix-rules` example from the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Read the README carefully. Take some time to explore the code, it
should contain comments to help you understand what is going on.

You should be able to access whoami at <http://whoami.localhost/whoami>.

Same as before, but this time, the reverse proxy has mapped the
`whoami.localhost` domain and the `/whoami` path to the whoami container.

Now, run the `whoami-with-traefik-pathprefix-rule-and-stripper-middleware`
example from the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Read the README carefully. Take some time to explore the code, it
should contain comments to help you understand what is going on.

You should be able to access whoami at
<http://localhost/whoami-without-stripprefix> and
<http://localhost/whoami-with-stripprefix>.

The output of <http://localhost/whoami-without-stripprefix> should be similar to
the following:

```text
Hostname: 25eeca6ff2bb
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.26.0.5

X-Forwarded-Server: 880dafe26d2a
X-Real-Ip: 192.168.65.1
```

The output of <http://localhost/whoami-with-stripprefix> should be similar to
the following:

```text
Hostname: 27cf1df3b435
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 172.26.0.4
RemoteAddr: 172.26.0.2:33656

X-Forwarded-Prefix: /whoami-with-stripprefix
X-Forwarded-Proto: http
X-Forwarded-Server: 880dafe26d2a
X-Real-Ip: 192.168.65.1
```

You should notice the following differences:

- `GET /whoami-without-stripprefix HTTP/1.1`: the HTTP request from the client
- `GET / HTTP/1.1`: the HTTP request from the client

The reverse proxy has stripped the `/whoami-with-stripprefix` path from the
request before forwarding it to the whoami container. The whoami container has
received the request without the `/whoami-with-stripprefix` path as if it was
the root path, thanks to the `stripprefix` middleware.

This configuration can be useful in some contexts (e.g. when you want to serve
static content from a subdirectory).

Thanks to these capabilities, a reverse proxy can be used to build a web
infrastructure that can serve multiple domains on the same IP address and that
can scale.

## System scalability

System scalability is the capability of a system to handle a growing amount of
work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

In Caching with Javalin, scalability is the capability of a system to handle a
growing amount of requests that are sent by clients to one or more servers.

There are two types of scalability:

- **Vertical scaling**: adding more resources (CPU/RAM/Disk) to an existing
  server. This is also called **scaling up**.
- **Horizontal scaling**: adding more servers to an existing system. Then, use
  load-balancing to distribute the work between the servers. This is also called
  **scaling out**.

Some variations of these two main types of scalability exist, such as elastic
scaling (adding or removing resources (CPU/RAM/Disk) on the fly). However, we
will not cover them in this course.

Both vertical and horizontal scaling are used to improve the performance of a
system to handle more requests (e.g. a lot of users on your website).

### Vertical scaling

Vertical scaling is limited by the hardware: at a certain point, you cannot add
more/better resources to a server.

### Horizontal scaling

Horizontal scaling is often limited by the software.

Instead of adding more resources to your server, you add more (smaller) servers
to your system.

Your software must be able to scale horizontally as well (multiple backends/API
accessing to one or more databases at the same time, multiple frontends
accessing the same backends, etc.), and it is not always possible.

### When to use scale up or scale out?

Scaling must be determined by the non-functional requirements (= needs) of of
your system. In order to determine the best scaling strategy, you must know the
bottlenecks of your system. Bottlenecks can only be identified by load testing
your system and monitoring it to get metrics.

There are a few metrics that can help you to determine the bottlenecks of your
system:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk usage
- Network usage
- Number of requests per second
- Response time
- Availability
- etc.

**Only from metrics, you can determine the bottlenecks of your system.**

Once you know the bottlenecks of your system, you can determine the best scaling
strategy.

I (Ludovic) recommend to use vertical scaling as much as possible before
switching to horizontal scaling. Adding new resources to a server is (usually)
easy and fast. Horizontal scaling is (much) more complex to setup and maintain
and can introduce new issues (e.g. network latency, data consistency, etc.). It
is also more expensive (usually).

### How to monitor your system?

There are a lot of tools to monitor your system. Here are a few examples:

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
- [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)
- [LibreNMS](https://www.librenms.org/)

Monitoring your system is a complex task and is out of the scope of this course.
You will learn more about monitoring in future courses.

## Load balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing a set of tasks over a set of
resources (computing units), with the aim of making their overall processing
more efficient.

Thanks to the reverse proxy and the `Host` header, a load balancer can be used
to distribute requests between multiple servers to achieve horizontal scaling.
This is only possible thanks to the fact that HTTP is a stateless protocol.

In order to distribute requests between multiple servers, a load balancer must
know the servers it can forward requests to. This is called a **pool** of
servers.

A load balancer can distribute requests between multiple servers using different
strategies:

- **Round-robin**: the load balancer forwards requests to each server in the
  pool in turn.
- **Sticky sessions**: the load balancer forwards requests from the same client
  to the same server with the help of a cookie.
- **Least connections**: the load balancer forwards requests to the server with
  the least number of active connections.
- **Least response time**: the load balancer forwards requests to the server
  with the least response time.
- **Hashing**: the load balancer forwards requests to the server based on a hash
  of the request (e.g. the IP address of the client, the URL of the request,
  etc.).

Run the `whoami-with-traefik-host-rule-and-sticky-sessions` example from the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository. Read the README carefully. Take some time to explore the code, it
should contain comments to help you understand what is going on.

You should be able to access the whoami instances at <http://whoami1.localhost>
and <http://whoami2.localhost>.

Notice that the `Hostname` and `IP` values are different for each instance.

In the first example, the load balancer uses the round-robin strategy to
distribute requests between the three whoami instances.

In the second example, the load balancer uses the sticky-session strategy to
always forward requests from the same client to the same whoami instance with
the help of a cookie.

The sticky-session strategy is useful when you want to keep the state of a
client on the same server: if a client is making an order on your website, you
want to keep the state of the order on the same server to avoid issues.

## Caching

Caching is the process of storing data in a cache. A cache is a temporary
storage component area where data is stored so that future requests for that
data can be served faster.

Caching can be used to improve the performance of a system by serving cached
data instead of processing a request again. Caching significantly improves the
performance of a system because it avoids processing the same request multiple
times.

This has several advantages:

- The client will receive the response faster, especially when the client itself
  (browser) has cached the response.
- The server does not have to process the request (parse the request, query the
  database, compose the response, etc).
- The network does not have to carry the messages along the entire path between
  client and server.

It however introduces some complexity because it is difficult to know when to
invalidate a cache. If a cache is not invalidated, it can serve stale data.

Caching can be done on the client-side or on the server-side:

- **Client-side caching**: once a client has received a response from a server,
  it can store the response in a cache. The next time the client needs the same
  resource, it can use the cached response instead of sending a new request to
  the server.
- **Server-side caching**: the server stores data in a cache with the help of a
  reverse proxy. The next time the server needs the same resource, it can use
  the cached response instead of processing the request again.

### Managing cache with HTTP

Managing cache is challenging because it is difficult to know when to invalidate
a cache. If a cache is not invalidated, it can serve stale data.

There are two main caching models:

- **Expiration model**: the cache is valid for a certain amount of time.
- **Validation model**: the cache is valid until the data is modified.

Expiration and validation are two mechanisms that can be used to control
caching.

Expiration is the process of specifying how long a response can be cached.

Validation is the process of checking if a cached response is still valid.

Both can be used at the same time to improve the performance of the system.

Much more details about caching with HTTP can be found on MDN Web Docs:
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching>.

#### Expiration model

The expiration model is the simplest caching model. It is described in
[RFC 2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13.2).

The cache is invalidated after a certain amount of time. The cache can be
invalidated after a certain amount of time because the data is not expected to
change.

The expiration model can be used to cache static content (e.g. images, videos,
etc.) or to cache responses from servers to improve the performance of the
system.

The expiration model can be implemented with the following header:

- `Cache-Control: max-age=<number of seconds>`: specifies the maximum amount of
  seconds a resource will be considered fresh. and responses.

![Expiration model](./images/expiration-model.png)

#### Validation model

The validation model is more complex than the expiration model. It is described
in [RFC 2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13.3).

The cache is invalidated when the data is modified. The cache can be invalidated
when the data is modified because the data is expected to change.

The validation model can be used to cache responses from servers to improve the
performance of the system.

The main idea of the validation model is:

1. Send a request to the server to check if the data has changed.
2. If the data has not changed, the server can return a `304 Not Modified`
   response to the client.
3. If the data has changed, the server can return a `200 OK` response to the
   client with the new data.

The request to check if the data has changed is called a **conditional
request**.

There are two types of conditional requests:

- **Based on the `Last-Modified` header**: allows a `304 Not Modified` to be
  returned if content is unchanged since the last time it was modified.
- **Based on the `ETag` header**: allows a `304 Not Modified` to be returned if
  content is unchanged for the version/hash of the given entity.

##### Based on the `Last-Modified` header

With HTTP, the validation model can be implemented with the following headers:

- `Last-Modified`: indicates the date and time at which the origin server
  believes the selected representation was last modified.
- `If-Modified-Since`: allows a `304 Not Modified` to be returned if content is
  unchanged since the time specified in this field (= the value of the
  `Last-Modified` header).

The `Last-Modified` header is used to check if the data has changed since the
last time it was modified.

##### Based on the `ETag` header

With HTTP, the validation model can be implemented with the following headers:

- `ETag`: provides the current entity tag for the selected representation. Think
  of it like a version number or a hash for the given resource.
- `If-None-Match`: allows a `304 Not Modified` to be returned if content is
  unchanged for the entity specified (`ETag`) by this field (= the value of the
  `ETag` header).

The `ETag` header is used to check if the data has changed since the last time
it was modified.

### CDN

Content delivery networks (CDNs) are a type of cache that can be used to serve
static content (e.g. images, videos, etc.) to clients.

A CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data
centers.

A CDN can be used to improve the performance of a system by serving static
content to clients from the closest server.

### Where to cache?

Caching can be done on the client-side, on the server-side, or on a CDN.

Private caches are caches that are only used by one client. Public caches are
caches that are used by multiple clients.

The best would be to cache at each level of the system to ensure the best
performance but it is not always possible or faisable.

## Conclusion

### What did you do and learn?

In this chapter, you have learned about functional and non-functional
requirements, what a web infrastructure is and what components it is composed
of, what a reverse proxy and a load balancer are and how they can be used to
build a web infrastructure.

Thanks to the `Host` header, you have learned how a reverse proxy can serve
multiple domains on the same IP address.

Thanks to the following features of HTTP, you were able to make use of them to
build a web infrastructure to serve multiple domains on the same IP address and
to scale:

- **Statelessness**: HTTP servers don’t have to store information about the
  state of a client: the client has to send all the information with each
  request (a cookie session for example) so the server can find the context to
  handle the request.
- **Scalability**: Several identical servers can handle requests without
  coordination: the client can send a request to any server, and the server can
  handle the request.
- **Reliability**: After a server failure, another server can easily take over
  the work (if the server is stateless).

### Test your knowledge

At this point, you should be able to answer the following questions:

- What is a reverse proxy? What is a load balancer? How do they differ?
- What is the `Host` header? How can it be used to serve multiple domains on the
  same IP address?
- What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?
- What is the difference between a CDN and a reverse proxy cache?
- What is the difference between expiration and validation caching models?
