## Introduction

We use CLI tools every day. For example, we use Git (with its `git` command line
interface) to manage our code , Maven (with its `mvn` and `mvnw` command line
interface) to build our projects, Java (with its `javac` and `java` command line
interface) to run our programs, etc.

In this practical work, you will create a CLI using
[picocli](https://picocli.info/) to process files.

The CLI will take an input file and an output file as arguments. It will also
take optional arguments to customize the CLI (such as the input file encoding
and the output file encoding - the default being UTF-8 for example). The CLI
will process the input file and write the result in the output file. It will
display a message on success and a message on failure.

You have the freedom to define what the CLI will do. You can be creative! For
example, you can choose to transform a text file (find/replace/count number of
occurrences/etc.), to grayscale a JPEG/PNG binary file manipulating its pixel
values, add metadata to existing TIFF files, etc.

If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we can give you some ideas.

Multiple groups can choose the same processing and you can share your
methodology but please do not copy/paste code from other groups.

## Objectives

- Create a CLI to process files using the Java classes seen in class
- Practice a Git workflow to work in a team
- Share common configurations (IDE + build tool)

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do
not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2024-2025 - Practical work 1 - First name Last name member 1
  and First name Last name member 2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Please do it a soon as possible**, even if you do not have a clear idea yet
> as it will help us to plan the practical work presentations.
>
> Please refer to the grading criteria to know what is expected from you.

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -----: |
| 23  | The application is presented and a demo is made as you would do it to a colleague/another team/boss/client/investor so they can understand what you created, why and how |    0.2 |

## Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven wlth the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the picocli dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course to process the files
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  ones presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no need
  to shoot for the moon!)

## Remarks

Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Silly! Sometimes it is better to
use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your implementation is too complex, we might penalize you.

You can use any other dependencies you want in your Maven project. You must
however explain why and how you use it in your README.

You can protect the `main` branch of your repository to prevent any push on it
and force signed commits from team members. This will force all team members to
use signed pull requests to merge your work.

## Submission

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the latest commit hash
  of your work before submission

**Your work is due on the day before the presentations at 23h59**. Check the
[Planning](https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/projects) for the exact
date.

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay
will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
