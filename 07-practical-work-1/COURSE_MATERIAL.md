## Introduction

We use command line interface (CLI) tools every day. For example, we use Git to
manage our code (with its `git` command line interface), Maven to build our
projects (with its `mvn` and `mvnw` command line interface), Java (with its
`javac` and `java` command line interface) to run our programs, etc.

In this practical work, you will create a CLI using
[picocli](https://picocli.info/) to process files.

The CLI will take an input file and an output file as arguments. It will also
take optional arguments to customize the CLI (such as the input file encoding
and the output file encoding - the default being UTF-8 for example). The CLI
will process the input file and write the result in the output file. It will
display a message on success and a message on failure.

You have the freedom to define what the CLI will do. You can be creative! For
example, you can choose to transform a text file (find/replace/count number of
occurrences/etc.), to grayscale a JPEG/PNG binary file manipulating its pixel
values, add metadata to existing TIFF files, etc.

Multiple groups can choose the same processing and you can share your
methodology and take inspiration from/help each other. However, you are not
allowed to plagiarize the code of another group. You will be penalized if you do
so with 1 as the final grade.

## Objectives

- Create a CLI to process files with Java IOs
- Practice Java, Maven and [picocli](https://picocli.info/)
- Practice a Git workflow to share your work with your team

## Group composition

You will work in groups of two students. You can choose your partner. If you do
not have a partner, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2024-2025 - Practical work 1 - First name Last name member 1
  and First name Last name member 2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Please do it a soon as possible**, even if you do not have a clear idea yet
> as it will help us to plan the practical work presentations.
>
> Please refer to the grading criteria to know what is expected from you.

## Idea validation

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

This will ensure that you have a good balance between the complexity of the
practical work and the time you have to complete it.

If you do not have any idea, come to see us and we can help you finding some
ideas.

## Grading criteria

- 0 point - The work is insufficient
- 0.1 point - The work is done
- 0.2 point - The work is well done (without the need of being perfect)

Maximum grade: 25 points \* 0.2 + 1 = 6

## Constraints

- The application must be written in Java, compatible with Java 21
- The application must be built using Maven with the `maven-shade-plugin` plugin
- The application must use the picocli dependency
- You can only use the Java classes seen in the course to process the files (you
  can use other libraries to help you once the files are opened)
- Your application must be slightly more complex and slightly different than the
  examples presented during the course (we emphasize the word **slightly**, no
  need to shoot for the moon!)

## Remarks

Remember the KISS principle: Keep it simple, silly! Sometimes it is better to
use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your implementation is too complex, we might penalize you.

You can use any other dependencies you want in your Maven project. You must
however explain why and how you use it in your README.

You can protect the `main` branch of your repository to prevent any push on it
and force signed commits from team members. This will force all team members to
use signed pull requests to merge your work.

## Submission

You must update the GitHub Discussion you created previously with the following
information:

- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the commit hash you
  want to submit

**Your work is due on the day before the presentations at 23h59**. Check the
[Planning](https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/projects) for the exact
date.

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay
will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

## Grades and feedback

Grades will be entered into GAPS, followed by an email with the feedback.

The evaluation will use exactly the same grading grid as shown in the course
material.

Each criterion will be accompanied by a comment explaining the points obtained,
a general comment on your work and the final grade.

If you have any questions about the evaluation, you can contact us!
