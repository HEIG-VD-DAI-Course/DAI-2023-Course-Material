## Practical work 1

- A CLI to process files
- Use Java, Maven and [picocli](https://picocli.info/)
- You can choose what the CLI will do (you can be creative!)
  - Transform the input file to lowercase/uppercase, convert a PNG to JPEG, ...
- Publish your CLI on GitHub

![bg right:40%][illustration]

## Demo

- Compile the project

```sh
mvn clean package
```

- Run the CLI without any arguments

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

```text
Missing required options: '--input=<inputFile>', '--output=<outputFile>'
Usage: IoProcessing [-hV] -i=<inputFile> [-ie=<inputEncoding>] -o=<outputFile>
                    [-oe=<outputEncoding>] [COMMAND]
Process an input file and return a result.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -i, --input=<inputFile>   The input file.
      -ie, --input-encoding=<inputEncoding>
                            The input file encoding.
  -o, --output=<outputFile> The output file.
      -oe, --output-encoding=<outputEncoding>
                            The output file encoding.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  uppercase  Converts the input file to uppercase.
  lowercase  Converts the input file to lowercase.
```

---

- Run the CLI with the `uppercase` command

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -i input.txt -o output.txt uppercase
```

- You can also specify the encoding of the input and output files

```sh
java -jar target/practical-work-1-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
    -i input.txt -ie UTF-8 \
    -o output.txt -oe US-ASCII uppercase
```

## See the result

```sh
$> cat input.txt
Coucou ça va ?
```

```sh
$> cat output.txt
COUCOU ?A VA ?
```

Why is the `ç` not converted to uppercase?

## Practical work review

The practical work review will take place on **Tuesday 10.10.2023** in the
**room B38**, at the very end of the corridor next to the door entry.

We only have **5 minutes per group**. Please be prepared to present your work.
You decide what you want to show us and how you want to present it.

Come 5 minutes before your time slot with your computer.

The order of presentation is random and is stated in the next slides.
