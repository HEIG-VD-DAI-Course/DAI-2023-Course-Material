## Introduction

Web applications are accessible from anywhere in the world. You can access them
from your computer, your smartphone, your tablet, etc. using a web browser,
mobile application or even a command line tool.

In this practical work, you will create a web application that uses the HTTP
protocol.

The web application will be defined by an application protocol interface (API)
and will be deployed on a virtual machine and accessible from the Internet using
a domain name.

You can interact with the web application using your web browser and/or a
command line tool such as curl or you can develop your own application client.

The API will be defined by you.

Feel free to be creative and to create a web application that you would like to
use. It can be a web application that you would like to use in your daily life
or a web application that you would like to use for your studies. For example,
you can choose to create a web application that allows you to manage your
shopping list, a web application that allows you to manage your tasks, a web
application that allows you to manage your notes, etc. If you do not have any
idea, come to see us and we can give you.

Multiple groups can choose the same application protocol and you can share your
methodology but please do not copy/paste code from other groups.

## Objectives

- Dialog with the IT department of the HEIG-VD to get a virtual machine on our
  cloud infrastructure
- Access the virtual machine with SSH
- Install Docker and Docker Compose on the virtual machine
- Define some Docker Compose files to run the web application with a reverse
  proxy (Traefik)
- Deploy the simple CRUD API on the virtual machine
- Access the CRUD API from a domain name

## Group composition

As the end of the semester is approaching, we know you have a lot of work to do
for other courses.

As this practical work is more complex than the previous ones, you can work in
groups between two and four students. You can choose your partners. If you do
not have a partner or a group, we will assign you one.

To announce your group, create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2023-2024 - Practical work 4 - First name Last name member 1,
  First name Last name member 2, First name Last name member 3 and First name
  Last name member 4
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: A quick description of what you will achieve during this
  practical work

The teaching staff might ask you to change the scope of your practical work if
it is too complex or too simple.

**Please do it a soon as possible, even if you do not have a clear idea yet as
it will help us to plan the practical work review.**

## Guidelines

In order for this practical work to be successful, you must follow the following
steps:

1. [Obtain a virtual machine](#obtain-a-virtual-machine)
2. [Install and configure the virtual machine](#install-and-configure-the-virtual-machine)
3. [Obtain a domain name](#obtain-a-domain-name)
4. [Run the secure Traefik and whoami examples](#run-the-secure-traefik-and-whoami-examples)
5. Develop the web application

Steps 1, 3 can be done in parallel before steps 2 and 4. Step 5 can be started
right away.

### Obtain a virtual machine

#### Order the virtual machine

You must send an email to the IT department of the HEIG-VD to get a virtual
machine on our cloud infrastructure.

Define a person in the group that will be the contact person for the virtual
machine. This person will be responsible for the virtual machine and will be
contacted by the IT department if there is a problem with the virtual machine.

The contact email is: [`mehdi.salhi@hes-so.ch`](mailto:mehdi.salhi@hes-so.ch).

You have a template email below. Please take some time to understand what
information you need to provide and why.

Replace the `<Prénom Nom de l'étudiant-e>` and
`<Date de début de mise en service>` placeholders with the correct information.

For the `<Date de début de mise en service>` placeholder, set it for the end of
the week. The IT department will need some time to create the virtual machine.

For the `<Date de fin de service>` placeholder, set it for the end of the
semester. The virtual machine will be deleted at the end of the semester.

**Please do it as soon as possible!**

</details>

#### Wait for the virtual machine

The IT department will send you an email with the information to access the
virtual machine with the following information:

- The internal IP address of the virtual machine (to access it with SSH)
- The external IP address of the virtual machine (to access it from the
  Internet)
- The username to access the virtual machine
- The password to access the virtual machine

### Install and configure the virtual machine

#### Access the virtual machine

Once the virtual machine is created, you can access it using its internal IP
with SSH as seen in the
[SSH and SCP](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/20-ssh-and-scp)
chapter.

You will have to be connected to the
[VPN](https://intranet.heig-vd.ch/services/informatique/poste-de-travail/reseau/vpn/Pages/vpn.aspx).
It is mandatory.

#### Update the virtual machine and install `apache2-utils`

Once you have access to the virtual machine, you can update it with the
following commands:

```sh
# Update the list of packages
sudo apt update

# Upgrade the packages
sudo apt upgrade
```

This will ensure that the virtual machine is up-to-date.

Install `apache2-utils` with the following command:

```sh
# Install apache2-utils
sudo apt install apache2-utils
```

This will ensure that you can use the `htpasswd` command line tool to create
users for the Traefik dashboard in a future step.

#### Install Docker and Docker Compose on the virtual machine

Install Docker and Docker Compose as seen in the
[Docker and Docker Compose](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/06-docker-and-docker-compose)
chapter.

As the virtual machine is running Linux, follow the instructions for Linux. Do
not forget the post-installation steps. This will ensure that Docker and Docker
Compose start automatically when the virtual machine is rebooted and that you
can use Docker without the need of using `sudo` (= admin) each time.

Check that you can run the `hello-world` Docker image as seen in the Docker and
Docker Compose chapter to ensure you can use Docker on the virtual machine
without the need of `sudo`.

#### Clone the example repository on the virtual machine

Clone the
[`heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples)
repository to get the code examples but this time, **clone it using HTTPS**.

This will ensure that you can clone the repository without the need of an SSH
configuration (useful when you are not on your own computer).

#### Try to access the whoami applications from the Internet

> [!WARNING]  
> This step might fail, it is normal. You will have to fix it in the next step.

Start the `whoami-on-ports-80-and-443` example available in the
[`24-practical-work-3`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples/tree/main/24-practical-work-3)
directory.

This should start two whoami containers on ports `80` and `443` on the virtual
machine.

You should notice that the application is not accessible from the Internet
(yet).

This is because the virtual machine is protected by a firewall. You will have to
open the ports on the virtual machine to allow the traffic to go through.

#### Open the ports on the virtual machine

You can open the port of the virtual machine using
[UFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall) with the following
command:

```sh
# Open the HTTP protocol on the virtual machine
sudo ufw allow http

# Open the HTTPS protocol on the virtual machine
sudo ufw allow https
```

#### Check out everything is now working

Using the external IP address of the virtual machine, try to access the whoami
applications from the Internet again.

This time, you should be able to access the application from the Internet!

You have confirmed that you can access the application(s) deployed on the
virtual machine from the Internet.

You can now stop the application on the virtual machine with
`docker compose down`.

### Obtain a domain name

If you already own a domain name, you can use it for the purpose of this
practical work.

If you do not have a domain or you do not want to use your own domain, you will
acquire a free domain name for the purpose of this practical work.

You can register a free domain name at <https://desec.io/>. Unlike other
providers, this provider allows you to create 15 domain names per account with
sub-domains for free. In addition, the provider is open-source and does not bind
you to some shady terms and conditions.

Create an account on <https://desec.io/> and register a domain name. Please use
the option **Register a new domain under dedyn.io (dynDNS)** to register a
domain name under the `dedyn.io` domain.

The domain name can be anything you want. It does not have to be related to the
practical work nor this course and you can use it for other purposes in the
future as well.

### Run the secure Traefik and whoami examples

> [!NOTE]  
> You might need to finish the
> [Web infrastructures](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course/tree/main/22-web-infrastructures)
> chapter before this step.

Start the `traefik-secure` and `whoami-with-traefik-secure` examples in the
[`24-practical-work-3`](https://github.com/heig-vd-dai-course/heig-vd-dai-course-code-examples/tree/main/24-practical-work-3)
directory.

> [!NOTE]  
> You can run the advanced Traefik and whoami examples if you want. They are
> more complex but they are more versatile and easier to maintain.
>
> They are not required for this practical work.

If you are able to access the Traefik dashboard and the whoami application from
the Internet, you have successfully configured Traefik to use HTTPS with a
domain name.

You now have all the required elements to deploy and run your web application on
the Internet!

  presented during the course
- The web application can only use the HTTP protocol
- You must build and release the application using Docker and Docker Compose
- You must use Traefik as the reverse proxy with a domain name to access the web
  application
- You must use Docker and Docker Compose to run the web application

## Remarks

Remember the KISS principle: Keep It Simple, Silly! Sometimes it is better to
use a simple solution than a complex one.

If your implementation is too complex, we might penalize you.

If elements that are supposed to be acquired through the course or previous
practical works are omitted, forgotten or poorly implemented, we might penalize
you.

If you have a domain name, you can use it. If you do not have a domain name, you
will obtain a free domain name for the purpose of this practical work.

You can protect the `main` branch of your repository to prevent any push on it
and force signed commits from team members. This will force all team members to
use signed pull requests to merge your work.

## Submission

Your work is due on the **day of the presentations** (the _"Practical work
review"_ sessions in the official planning available at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/projects>) at **13:15**.

Any commit after the deadline will not be taken into account. Each day of delay
will result in a penalty of -1 point on the final grade.

You must create a new GitHub Discussion at
<https://github.com/orgs/heig-vd-dai-course/discussions> with the following
information:

- **Title**: DAI 2023-2024 - Practical work 4 - @member1 and @member2
- **Category**: Show and tell
- **Description**: The link to your repository as well as the latest commit hash
  of your work before submission
