## Practical work 4

- Get a virtual machine on our cloud
- Access the virtual machine (SSH)
- Install Docker and Docker Compose
- Develop a simple CRUD API
- Deploy the applications (reverse proxy + CRUD API)
- Access the applications from a (free) domain name

![bg right:40%][illustration]

---

- A CRUD API to manage resources
- You can choose what the CRUD API does/manages:
  - Music
  - Books
  - Video games
  - A todo list
  - Groceries
  - ...
- **Groups of 4 students**

![bg right:40%][illustration]

## Demo

<!-- _class: lead -->

The API for the demonstration is accessible at  
<https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io>.

---

Locally - Compile the project:

```sh
./mvnw clean package
```

Locally - Build the Docker image with Docker Compose:

```sh
docker compose build
```

Locally - Publish the Docker image to the container registry:

```sh
docker compose push
```

---

On the server - Pull the Docker image from the container registry:

```sh
docker compose pull
```

On the server - Start Traefik (the reverse proxy):

```sh
docker compose -f traefik/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

On the server - Start the CRUD API:

```sh
docker compose -f api/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

---

Create a few drinks:

```sh
# Hot wine
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Hot wine","description":"Hot wine with spices","price":3.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks

# Christmas tea
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Christmas tea","description":"Warm tea","price":2.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks
```

---

Get the list of drinks:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Hot wine",
    "description": "Hot wine with spices",
    "price": 3.0
  }
  // All the other drinks
]
```

---

Filter the drinks with a price equal to 2.0 CHF:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks?price=2.0
```

Output:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Christmas tea",
    "description": "Warm tea",
    "price": 2.0
  }
]
```

---

Get a specific drink:

```sh
curl https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks/1
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Hot wine",
  "description": "Hot wine with spices",
  "price": 3.0
}
```

---

Update a drink:

```sh
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Hot wine","description":"Nice hot wine","price":3.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks/1
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Hot wine",
  "description": "Nice hot wine",
  "price": 3.0
}
```

---

Delete a drink:

```sh
curl -X DELETE -i https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks/1
```

Output:

```text
HTTP/2 204
content-type: text/plain
date: Sat, 16 Dec 2023 13:31:56 GMT

```

No content as we return a `204` (No Content) status code!

---

Adding another drink with the same name:

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Christmas tea","description":"Another tea","price":2.0}' \
  https://heig-vd-dai-course.dedyn.io/drinks
```

Output:

```text
Conflict
```

Leads to a `409` (Conflict) status code as we want to keep the names unique.

## Guidelines

**This is important, please read carefully!**

- State your group on GitHub Discussions before the end of the day!
- Define someone in your group as the responsible
- **Write to the IT department** to get a virtual machine as soon as possible
  (**before the end of the day**!)
  - Use the template email provided in the course material.
  - Put the teaching staff in CC.

## Practical work review

The practical work review will take place on **Tuesday 23.01.2024** in the
**room B51a**, next to our classroom.

We only have **10 minutes per group** (10 minutes of presentation, no time for
questions). Please be prepared to present your work. You decide what you want to
show us and how you want to present it.

Come 5 minutes before your time slot with your computer.

The order of presentation is random and is stated in the next slides.
